I am writing regarding the Ashokan Reservoir plans to build a hydro plant.  first of all, I would not want to drink water that was residing above a hydro plant, I would imagine there are risk with this.  Secondly, these projects sometime fail and the risk to the local environment, ecological systems would be devastating as well as having no water for NYC residents.  
Im sure there must be a healthier, less toxic way of creating energy...solar, wind power as it is very windy up here.  Im sure an architect could draw up a simple plan of covering the wind power so that they don't ice up like they did in Texas.  
I personally feel as if the government just randomly makes decisions not taking all into account of the devastation if there is an accident.  I guess if you don't live here, you don't care.
Just my two cents,
Thanks,
Ann
