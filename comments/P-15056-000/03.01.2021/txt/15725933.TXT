Dear Ms. Bose

This is a filing concerning docket # P-15056-000.

My family has had a home in the Woodland Valley near Phoenicia, NY for 75 years. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Please do not allow Premium Energy to destroy this piece of paradise with an unnecessary power plant reservoir. Let Premium Energy make (or lose) their money someplace else. The plan to make a reservoir in the Woodland Valley would not only destroy our homestead but would desecrate an area of spectacular natural beauty. It must not be allowed to happen. Do not let the bulldozers into our valley. Be proactive! Stop Premium Energy now.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Carl & Sabina Tannenbaum
