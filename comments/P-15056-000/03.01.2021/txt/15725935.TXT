Hi,

I have a property with woodland valley creek access as part of my lot.
I object to the project of using Woodland Valley as a smaller reservoir for the Ashokan Reservoir.
I would not be able to live on my property and your project would endanger the life of animals of the state land adjacent to my property.

Please showcase that you have made a study on economical impact and natural impact of such project.

Regards,
Stephane Sesquin.
