To whom it may concern,

I OPPOSE this project. My family has owned a home on Woodland Valley for over 100 years.  Built by my Great Grandfather.  I go every summer for the past 40 years to visit.  I have seen first hand how delicate the balance is on Woodland Creek between normal and floods.  A simple search would show you the damage that was done in the last major flood.  With climate change a fact and expecting more severe weather, we should NOT be changing anything with the water around Woodland Valley.  

It is a fact that Hydro-Power plants are more damaging to the environment than Wind or Solar.   We should be looking into those solutions and not something like this.   A tunnel?  Connecting Water?  A new dam?  In an area prone to flooding?  This is a disaster in the making.   Causing damage to property and the plants and animals that live in the area.  

Do not approve this project.   It will have lasting negative impact to a beautiful natural habitat that should be protected and not destroyed.   

Thank you,

Ira Rubenstein
