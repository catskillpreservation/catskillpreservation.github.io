Elizabeth Oâ€™Grady, Phoenicia, NY.
I am adamantly opposed to the possibility of Premium Energy, a California company, installing hydroelectric dams in the Woodland Valley Phoenicia area. It is my determination to make sure that the Valley is not compromised in any manner and not exploited or destroyed for commercial or any other interests.
