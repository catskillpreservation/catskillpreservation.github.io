Daming Woodland valley to create an upper pool would disrupt more citizens than it would serve. 

As a Chemical Engineer, I am currently collecting facts to quantify the damage the upper pool would create versus the benefit of power generation. 

Our team, located in the Wool\dand Valley, will submit additional comments once we have more information.

At first glance, the proposal is reckless and poorly thought through.
