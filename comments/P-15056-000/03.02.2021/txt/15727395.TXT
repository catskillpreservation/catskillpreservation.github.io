Dear FERC,

Smart renewable energy initiatives are critical to our countryâ€™s long term future stability. I support novel strategies on how we shift away from fossil fuels using hydro, wind, tidal, solar, and even nuclear to become energy independent as a country.

The Ashokan reservoir watershed is not a warranted place for a large scale hydro-battery type project. The proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings for the Ashokan PSP is nothing short of ludicrous to see  in 2021. Habitat, residences, history, recreation, geology will be disrupted in a NYC drinking water zone.  

From reporting on the subject,  it seems that the impacted communities and counties and even NYC were not advised that someone was paying for this study and application to take place. If this is the public rollout of this radical proposal,, what does that say about the motives of the company and funded behind it - or their ability to take on something as complex as what is being proposed. 

As a New York resident and someone who already lives down stream of the effects of the western Catskills Delaware reservoirs Please do not advance this proposal.

Matthew McMahon
