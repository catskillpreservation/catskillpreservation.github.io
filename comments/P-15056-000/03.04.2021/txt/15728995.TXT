I am writing regarding the Premium Energy Holdings LLC Preliminary Permit Application for a Pump Storage Facility utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir. This plan, and itâ€™s feasibility study, would do irreparable damage to our local ecological systems. The Woodstock and surrounding communities want to preserve what brought us to these areas- the beautiful natural environment of the Hudson Valley. I implore you to deny this project before it starts. The ecological health of our forests and waterways are more important to us than ever- and we will continue to fight to preserve them. Please help us protect our home. Thank you.
