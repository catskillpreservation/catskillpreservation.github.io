Some studies suggest hydropower may not be as harmless to the environment as fossil fuels. If hydropower is not more effective as a power source, and even the preliminary tests to see how viable a pump is at the Ashokan reservoir will screw up the ecology here, I suggest it will be detrimental to the community, and that the local government should not allow this to happen in a place that emphasizes preservation of the land.
