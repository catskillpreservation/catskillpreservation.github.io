I do not believe it would be in the area's best interest to grant this permit. If approved, the proposed project would cause ecological damage to the forests, streams, and wildlife in the area.  The permit would allow for the destruction of trees and for the construction of roads, as well as the use of explosives.  In my opinion, the risks will greatly outweigh any benefit.  We need to be especially wary and careful these days where the environment is concerned.  This project will be severely detrimental.
