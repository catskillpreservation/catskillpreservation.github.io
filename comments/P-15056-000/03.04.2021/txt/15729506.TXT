John Mickelson, West Hurley, NY.
Given the paucity of information and (intentional?)lack of spatial specificity as to exactly what the agency's proposal is or might be, it is difficult to fully assess the potential impacts that such an outrageous and seeming poorly planed project might have (what type of idiots do they think their pitching to, to suggest that the development they propose could be done for $5mil?!!!). But intentionally disturbing the NYC water supply by such a shabby group (as evidenced by simple Google searches, showing they've earned the title of "whack-a-dam"), with such a poor reputation across the country, for attempting, willy-nilly, to insert the very same type of for-cash scam, alone seems like sufficient reason to deny any further progress of the proposal. As an earth scientist with a graduate degree and 20+ years experience, I'd immediately be greatly concerned about the potential negative impacts and disturbance of the NYC impoundments and infrastructure caused by the apparent proposed penetration of associated ground water systems and surrounding surficial and bedrock geological underpinnings. 

This apparently foreign, for-profit corporation seeking to derive shareholder benefits at the expense and great risk to the NYC DEP and millions of NYC residents must be turned back. Or at the very least be required to conduct a *full* NYS SEQRA impact assessment, accompanied by full public hearings and reviews, before being allowed one inch of forward motion.
