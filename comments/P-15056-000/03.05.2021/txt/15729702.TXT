Basis for Intervening:
The City of New York (“City”) seeks to intervene in this proceeding on its own behalf and on behalf of the nine million people who rely on a daily basis on the City’s water supply system.  The City owns the Ashokan Reservoir, which comprises a large part of the proposed pump storage facility and is an important component of the City’s water supply system.  The City uses the Ashokan Reservoir to supply approximately 40% of the daily water supply needs of its approximately nine million customers.  The outcome of this proceeding could have a direct and significant impact on the City’s water supply system and its ability to serve its customers’ needs.  Accordingly, the City has a substantial interest in this matter.  No other party represents the City’s interests, and no other party reasonably could do so.  The City’s participation in this proceeding is therefore essential to ensure that the interests and concerns of the City and its constituents and customers are heard by the Commission.  The City also submits that its participation will help to advance the public interest.  For the forgoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.
