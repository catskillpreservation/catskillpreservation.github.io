Jill Bressler, Kerhonkson, NY.
I’m writing to express my opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric power station at the Ashokan Reservoir. I support sustainable energy. But this project and this company are the antithesis of green power. In other projects in the western United States, their plants have decimated fish species, putting them on the endangered species list. They deliberately target land that has Native American interests. The Sierra Club has opposed their projects after extensive analysis of the environmental impact has shown irreparable damage to the environment and the community. Why would we support this proposal or want it?

We live in a beautiful, pristine community. The Ashokan is central to living here. Please do not grant this company the right to destroy what we hold so dear.

Here are links to two stories about similar projects in Nevada and California.
