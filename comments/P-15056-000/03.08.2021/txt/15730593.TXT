This site is not only a beautiful ecological site and family area, but it is the first thing you see when driving into catskill park, and is a tourist attraction from all over the Hudson valley. Not only is its image important, but tourist attraction brings in vital income for the surrounding businesses in catskill park. Constructing this hydro power facility would destroy all of these vital points of interest. In addition to have a serious hazardous impact on the surrounding ecology, it simply would not be an effective source of power. I beg you to reconsider this project, for the sake of local residents, local businesses, tourists, and the surrounding environment that is continually being threatened.
