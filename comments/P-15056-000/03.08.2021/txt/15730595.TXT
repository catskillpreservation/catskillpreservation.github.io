I'm a concerned situation, who has lived and grown up around the Ashokan Reservoir. I'm asking the FERC to deny the preliminary permit for Premium Energy Holdings LLC. Even preliminary testing could damage what is an essential ecological resource. Our community, NYC residents, and so many animals/plants depend on this incredible ecosystem. Let's not tamper with it. The benefits are not worth the risks. Thank you.
