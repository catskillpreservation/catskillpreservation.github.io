Hi, I live in an area near the Ashokan Reservoir and I wanted to submit a comment about the proposed pumped storage facility. Supporting renewable energy is a good thing! but I am concerned about any unintended consequences.
The surveying and construction would obviously disrupt the land and wildlife of the area, so it needs to be determined whether that will all be worth it. The project should be sustainable and efficient while not significantly disrupting the landscape, wildlife, and community of the area. The local residents should also be involved in the process, and make sure the project will benefit the local community in the long term. And if not, alternative projects should be considered. 
Thank you.
