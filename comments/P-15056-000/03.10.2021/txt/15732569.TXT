Heather Crispell, OLIVEBRIDGE, NY.
As a life long resident of the town of Olive, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.

I am saddened to think what it would do to the wildlife that calls the protected reservoir property home, there are several nests of Bald Eagles very near the site, in fact the proposed power house would likely be in eye shot of one of the nests.  If the disruption to the town's people is not reason enough surly the danger it would pose to these protected species is.

Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward!!
