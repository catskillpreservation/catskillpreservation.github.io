Denise owens, Chichester, NY.
As a Twenty Year resident of one of the CHICHESTER, NY that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously OBJECT to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 
We are surviving COVID, Unemployment, Depression, and now the threat of losing our homes when we are trying to get our lives back.  This is cruel.

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to PREVENT and STOP THIS PROPOSAL FROM MOVING FORWARD. 


Sincerely,
Denise Owens
