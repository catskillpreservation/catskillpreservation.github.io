A. Lacey, New York, NY.
Docket number P-15056-000

Hello, I grew up in this area and still love spending time on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity.

I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, will damage local lands, roads, and streams and will negatively impact everyone living in this area of the Catskills. 

In addition, the increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for the nine million people in New York City will directly impact me, my family, and our greater community here in NYC. 

Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward, thereby protecting the environment and people, both in the Catskill Mountains and NYC.
