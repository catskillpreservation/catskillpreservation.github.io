Karen Charman, Shandaken, NY.
As a resident of Shandaken, one of the towns that is being targeted by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I strongly oppose the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit.

The proposed project is completely inappropriate in an area that happens to contain the New York City watershed and the Catskill Park, both public treasures. If constructed, the Premium Energy Holdings project will damage local lands, roads, and streams and increase turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. The construction would also likely harm the character of our rural community.

I am also very alarmed that Premium Holdings didn't notify the New York City Dept. of Environmental Protection before submitting its proposal and feel that the company's remiss does not bode well for harmonious community relations. 

Please do everything in your power to prevent this inappropriate and poorly conceived proposal from moving forward. Thank you.
