Judith E Fletcher, The Bronx, NY.
Docket number P-15056-000 

I write as someone who cares deeply about the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. I want to vehemently object to the proposal and request that the FERC deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project would be huge and intrusive.  If permitted to go forward, it would be almost certain to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
