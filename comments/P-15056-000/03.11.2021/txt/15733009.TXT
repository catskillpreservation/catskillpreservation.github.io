The Catskills and Ashokan Reservoir are highly valued for their aesthetic and environmental assets. As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Most importantly there are viable alternatives to produce electricity in much less harmful ways, which New York state is actively pursuing. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. If you need additional information please feel free to contact me. I look forward to your reply to my request. Thank you.
