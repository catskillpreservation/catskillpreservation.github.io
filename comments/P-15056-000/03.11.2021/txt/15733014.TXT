Karen Miller, Guilderland, NY.
docket number P-15056-000
As someone who recreates on and enjoys the beauty of the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary or any permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City, not to mention destroy our wildlife and nature. It is a travesty if they are allowed to come in and destroy this area. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
