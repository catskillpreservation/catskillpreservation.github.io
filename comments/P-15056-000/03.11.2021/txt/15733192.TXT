Sarah Wenk, KINGSTON, NY.
This project, coming out of nowhere, and unasked for by the community, must be stopped immediately. The Hudson Valley's natural resources are not for sale, and certainly not to a company that simply plunks their request down to the FERC without any information or warning to the surrounding region. 

Please do the right thing and stop this project now. It is unnecessary and unwanted.

Thank you,

Sarah Wenk
