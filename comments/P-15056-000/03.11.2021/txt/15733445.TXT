Nick Alba, Phoenicia, NY.
The proposal to flood Woodland Valley is totally preposterous.   I have been a homeowner and resident of this valley for 39 years, and there are more than 200 homes of varying sizes in this historic, picturesque setting, which is habitat to a variety of wildlife, and features a world class trout stream, and well as a NY State campground and access to the most popular trails in the Catskill Mountains which lead to many of our peaks.  
Let's not belabor this ridiculous proposal any longer, and simply withdraw the application.
Thank you.
