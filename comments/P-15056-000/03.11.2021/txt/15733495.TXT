I am writing to express my dismay with Premium Energyâ€™s application to create a pumped hydroelectric power station and set of reservoirs in the Catskill Mountain region of New York. This project would displace hundreds if not thousands of residents, and scar the beautiful and crucial wilderness areas of the region. Born and raised outside of Woodstock New York, my life has been endlessly enriched by access to these forever wild places, and they are a core aspect of our regions economy. Also, eminent domain may be an abstract concept to most communities in America, but this area still bears scars from a period of rampant land seizure associated with the construction of the NYC reservoirs a hundred years ago. Plans of this kind touch a nerve here, and I hope that FERC will recognize the substantially negative social, economic and natural impact of these plans before considering approval. Thank you for your time, and your service to our Nation.
