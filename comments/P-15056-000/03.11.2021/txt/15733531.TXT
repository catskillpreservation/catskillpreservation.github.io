Melissa Pierson, Olivebridge, NY.
I am a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. But more than that, I am a resident of one of the ever-dwindling places on earth where a semblance of wild and natural space still exists. This is where John Burroughs, one of the most important voices in naturalism, first experienced the sanctity of what this project will destroy for all time. I vigorously, vehemently, and to my last breath object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. As the plan is currently drawn, the pipeline will run through my front yard. Thus the most valuable things I have--my home, my environment--will be taken. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
