Regarding Docket # P15056-000, Application for Preliminary Permit for Document of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP under P-15056: I wish to register my objections to this project:
 
The proposal has very limited benefits (net power supply) vs the cost to the fragile, protected environment of the Catskills Park.

There would be disruption to local families and businesses. 

It was not created in cooperation with state and local government plans for use of the region

There must be other, better ways to capitalize on the flow of water through the NYC water distribution system, such as installing turbines adjacent to the aqueduct. Some parts of the aqueduct are already currently under rehabilitation. Only through consultation with the state and local authorities and utilities could these be explored.

In light of the above this proposal should be rejected based on cost/benefit, prematurity and lack of planning. Please protect the citizens of NY from this invasion and grab of property by an out-of-state private corporation.
