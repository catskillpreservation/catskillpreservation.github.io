I vigorously object to the project proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. Premium Energy Holdings wants to create an enormous underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir. If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets, as well as damming streams to create reservoirs as part of what is called “pumped storage”  - electricity to be generated using massive water transport tunnels. Tapping into any energy generated would also require massive new high power electric transmission networks. 

Premium Energy Holdings has not reached out to New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) or the local municipalities that would be impacted by the project. Transparency has not been at the forefront of this massive undertaking and environmentally detrimental project.
