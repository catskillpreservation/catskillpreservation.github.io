Basis for Intervening:
In having read the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposal, it my sense that this project risks both the natural characteristics of this area - namely the Catskills Park protected within the New York State Constitution as "forever wild" - as well as the primary industry of this area - tourism.  

A large hydro-electric dam and accompanying reservoir would not merely push aside hundreds of citizens through the necessary eminent domain seizures, but would fundamentally alter the largest industry in the entire county.  Over $500 million is spent on tourism each year in Ulster County and the largest part of that is directly connected to the mountains and streams that make the Catskills once of the prettiest parts of the country.

While clean energy is always a laudable goal, this project does not provide a sufficient return, or sufficient environmental benefits to offset the loss of an entire town hamlet, the destruction of vast areas of forest, and corresponding destruction of a major section of the local and regional economy.

As a resident of Shandaken, New York, my home and livelihood are intimately connected to the watershed of our region.  In this capacity, I respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission refuse any and all permits associated with this project.
