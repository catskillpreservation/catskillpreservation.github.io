John Smylie, Gardiner, NY.
Although I live a good deal southwest of the proposed project in Ulster County and am not a directly affected local resident, I write to voice my concerns and objections over the proposals by Premium Energy Holdings which threaten the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State. This is not an appropriate site for, as I understand the proposal, a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. As a person who often visits the area for its scenic and historic beauty, I strongly object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. This proposal is destructive to our communities and threatening to the role of the reservoir in providing clean drinking water for millions of people. Please take action to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
