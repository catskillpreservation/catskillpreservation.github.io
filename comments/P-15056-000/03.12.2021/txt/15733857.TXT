Leslie Gale Dornfeld, West Shokan - Town of Olive, NY.
I am a resident of the Town of Olive, where an application for an underground hydroelectric plant, dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels as well as other equipment for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity has been made.  I have closely examined information that is available to me.  This proposal would substantially negatively impact my property, affect my access to my house, and negatively affect the land, local streams, and overall quality of the environment in which I live.  I do not believe these impacts could be mitigated in any way.  With construction of this massive and intrusive project, there will likely be increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for 9 million NYC residents.  I vigorously object to this proposed project and hope that you will do everything possible to prevent it from moving forward.
