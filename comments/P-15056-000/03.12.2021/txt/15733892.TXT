Tobe Carey, Glenford, NY.
I strongly oppose the pumped storage system proposed for the Ashokan Reservoir/Esopus Creek area. It will negatively impact the areas in which it is proposed and as a frequent user of the Ashokan Reservoir for boating and fishing, and the Esopus Creek region for hiking and fishing it will have an undeniable negative impact on the region.

The fact that the application was made without informing local and NY City authorities of the plan before filing for permits indicates that the owners have little or no regard for the local or regional residents. I urge you to deny any permits that they have requested.

Thank you,
Tobe Carey
