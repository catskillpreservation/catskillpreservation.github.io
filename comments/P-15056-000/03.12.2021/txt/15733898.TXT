This will uproot my partner and I and the numbers of friends and neighbors who so regularity have concern for tomorrow but one thing we can count on is returning home to our houses in this beautiful, peaceful country- please do not uproot this.  The land in my town is blessed with Firever wild standings and this could also endanger the the nature and animals that are climbing their numbers back in the ecosystem.  There has to be alternatives for renewable energy and we deserve to consider all options, not have our hand forced


As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
