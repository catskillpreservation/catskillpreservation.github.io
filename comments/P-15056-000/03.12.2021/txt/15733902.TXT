Our propery is on the border between Town of Olive and Town of Rochester. We also border Catskill State Park Land.

This ill-advised and poorly planned proposal does not take into account the impact of residents in the area, displacing many and impacting public lands. While clean energy is important, the impact of this project would cause destruction of habitats as well as impact the whole water system. Residents would bear the burden that this would cause.

This permit should be denied and re-submission should require sound environmental and quality of life impact statements.
