Rebecca Hoffman, Big Indian, NY.
As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

I have bathed in those rivers since I was a child. I meet my neighbors down by the river. I found pollywogs in their shallows. Last year I saw a bald eagle fly over head, 20 feet from me. I have admired the wildflowers on their banks. I am teaching my nieces and nephews to love them, too. This land must remain forever wild. And develop a sustainable energy that does not destroy the environment. Please do the right thing and prevent this project.
