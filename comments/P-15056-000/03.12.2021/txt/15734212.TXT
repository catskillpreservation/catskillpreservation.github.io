Please accept this comment as my full disapproval of the this permit application.  The planned installation of a dam and reservoir in the Woodland Valley would have devastating consequences for our community.  The planned location is very near my property and would destroy the much valued Woodland Valley landscape.  It would also have many consequences to the wild fishery population of the Woodland Valley Stream that merges with the Esopus Creek nearby thus impacting recreational fishing activities and water management.
