Ann Morris, Woodstock, NY.
As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Please do not let this  proposed plan go through. This will destroy our beautiful environment and will decimate many many people’s lives. People who have lived here for generations, as well as people who have made this their home more recently. Not to mention destroying tourism in this part of the Catskills

Thank you, 

Ann Morris
Woodstock resident
