David R Congdon, Phoenicia, NY.
I am a resident of Woodland Valley, which is one of the hamlets under consideration by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam and reservoir.  Although I would be justified in vigorously objecting to this proposal as a resident whose home and neighborhood would be destroyed if this project is approved, my objections are far wider in scope.

I object to any expense incurred by Federal, State, County or Town governments in consideration of this bizarre and unbelievably misguided proposal.  My objections are on the grounds that it will negatively impact the natural assets that make this area of unique economic, scenic, recreational, and ecological value to New York and the entire Northeast region of the United States.  Here is a list of four assets (out of many more) which are under significant threat by this proposal:
1.  The water supply for 9 million people in the City of New York and surrounding New York counties.
2.  Breeding grounds for native trout species that provide a beneficial environment for the best fly-fishing recreation area in the eastern United States.
3.  The neighboring protected NYS DEC land designated as "forever wild" by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which enjoys the highest degree of protection of wild lands in any state.
4.  Local lands, roads, and streams that are a major economic asset supporting the larger Catskills community, and which will suffer irreparable damage.

As a resident whose family first moved to this area in 1810, I add my voice to all those who are calling on the FERC to do everything in its power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
