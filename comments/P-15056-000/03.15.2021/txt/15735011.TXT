Julie Parisi, Woodstock, NY.
I strongly urge you to deny the permit to Premium Energy Holdings LLC. 

As someone who has lived in Ulster County for my entire life and who spends time walking on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I strongly object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets, as well as damming streams to create reservoirs. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. It would be extremely harmful to local wildlife as well as the fish and other living creatures in the streams. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. 
Thank you.
