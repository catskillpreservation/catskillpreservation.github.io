Donna Cinelli, West Hurley, NY.
As a resident of West Hurley, NY which adjoins the lands of the Ashokan Resevoir that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I strenuously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit (docket #P-15056-000). The area is valued for the natural beauty of its protected woods and streams and infringes on land and water resources managed by the DEP. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, will damage the local economy and character, including lands, roads, streams, and cause increased turbidity in water serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for 9,000,000 people in New York City. 

The location is extremely unsuitable for such a project and I respectfully request that you prevent this proposal from moving forward.
