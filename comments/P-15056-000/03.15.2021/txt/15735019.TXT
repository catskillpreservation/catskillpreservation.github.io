Eve Fox, Woodstock, NY.
Dear FERC,
I'm writing to express my concern about this proposal which would dramatically impact the area in which I live both economically and environmentally. Although I whole heartedly support clean, renewable energy sources this project as roughly outlined does not appear to take into account our existing communities residents, economies or environment, to say nothing of its potential impact on the drinking water provided by the Ashokan Reservoir which accounts for roughly 40% of the drinking water supply of New York City.

Our area has already suffered a great deal to create the Ashokan Reservoir which has left bitter memories for residents of areas that were flooded to make way for this project that benefits New York City.

However, we have also come to appreciate the beauty and recreational (and economic) opportunities created by the Ashokan Reservoir including the new and very popular Ashokan Rail Trail that opened late in 2019 to much local acclaim. Businesses have begun to pop up near its access points and we welcome it as a fitting addition that amplifies our area's reputation for conservation and natural beauty. Although I would be happy to see hydropower utilized, in general, my understanding of this proposal seems like something our region will have to fight. And fight we will... As part of the successful grassroots effort to defeat Niagara Bottling's attempt to privatize water from the nearby Cooper Lake Reservoir in Woodstock a few years ago, I have no doubt that we can scuttle this project.

I encourage you to find other, more suitable locations (ideally using firms that are based in this region and have a strong understanding of potential locations) for a project of this scale.

Sincerely,
Eve Fox
