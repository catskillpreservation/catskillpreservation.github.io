Laura Nordstrom, Kingston, NY.
As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. Additionally, our area relies on the beauty of the Catskills not only for our recreation, but our economy. People come here from all over the state, country and world to visit the Catskills. If we allow this natural beauty to be destroyed, our restaurants, ski areas, hotels, small businesses and more will suffer. This plan directly aims to level some towns, but it could also effectively level the entire area with this economic loss. This is our land. These are our mountains and valleys. This is our home.
