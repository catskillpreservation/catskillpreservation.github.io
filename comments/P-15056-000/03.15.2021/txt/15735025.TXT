As someone a person who enjoys and recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the precious Catskill lands of New York State. This proposed  invasion by Premium Energy Holdings is a disaster.. I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. It is not only an environment disaster but a human disaster - destroying communities.. 

Thank you for your attention.
