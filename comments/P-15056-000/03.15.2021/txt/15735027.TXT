Jacqueline Lieske, Cottekill, NY.
I have lived in Saugerties, Woodstock, and now Cottekill all my life. For 36 years I have found solace and joy in the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. No one locally has asked for this work to be done, no one locally wants this work to be done. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
