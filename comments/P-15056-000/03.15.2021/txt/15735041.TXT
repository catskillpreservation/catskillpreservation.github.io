Christian Lynch, Phoenicia, NY.
As a full-time resident of the Woodland Valley in Phoenicia, NY (one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity), I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do everything in its power to deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, expensive and unnecessary.  If allowed to proceed, it will likely destroy or cause irreparable damage to local lands and streams, endanger native wildlife and possibly protected species, require massive road and infrastructural reconstruction while causing increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for more than nine million people in New York City. I strongly oppose the trampling of personal liberty and the flagrant disrespect of private property and public lands and urge the FERC to do everything in its power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
