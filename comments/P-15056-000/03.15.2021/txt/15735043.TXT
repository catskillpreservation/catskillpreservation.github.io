I strongly urge that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit for a hydroelectric project near the Ashokan Reservoir. I reside nearby and frequently use the lands near the reservoir for recreation. A large, intrusive industrial project in the neighborhood would severely affect the quality of life in the area and would be sure to result in pollution and environmental degradation in an area prized for its beauty and cleanness. In turn this could adversely affect the economy of the region which relies on its quality of life, beauty and cleanness to attract visitors and residents. The proposed project is too large for our small rural way of life and economy. Damage to roads and runoff of polluted water would be predictable results, and the quality of new York City's drinking water would be threatened.
