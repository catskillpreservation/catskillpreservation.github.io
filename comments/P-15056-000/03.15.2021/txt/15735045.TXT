Michal Keeley, Fleischmanns, NY.
As someone who hikes and bikes on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I strongly oppose the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdings' application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive and, if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters that provide an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Sincerely,
Michal Keeley
