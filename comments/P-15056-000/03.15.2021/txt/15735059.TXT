Merry Chellas, Albany, NY.
I have spent summers at our homes in Woodland Valley for 80 years; members of my family have visited there since the late 1800s.  We hope to continue spending time there for many more years. 

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  

The plan, if implemented, will severely damage many properties, as well as the roads, creeks and streams in our area.  It will endanger wildlife in the Catskill Park.  It will create excessive turbidity and endanger New York City's drinking water supply, most of which is unfiltered when it reaches residents.  And with the threat of climate change, it is unclear how such a project would be affected.  

I completely understand that creative solutions are required to meet the need.  However, this proposal has not been thought through and examined carefully.  For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water's direction is reversed. Reservoirs actually produce methane, a process that is not well understood.  The cost is way too high for the benefit realized.

I urge you to do whatever you can to block this unfortunate proposal from proceeding further. 

Thank you.
Merry Morehouse Chellas
