Re P-15056-000 Preliminary Permit re Ashokan

Four generations of my family have spent summers in Woodland Valley in two homes, since the 19th century, and I want to be able to bring my young children and their children there for many summers to come. I am writing to register my profound objections to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  
 
The plan, if implemented, would disrupt and damage many properties, roads, creeks and streams in our area, and endanger the wildlife in the Catskill Park. It will put a dent in tourism in the area and could foment unknown consequences as the climate change. Nine million people in New York City could be affected by endangering the water supply that springs forth from this area. 

This proposal is disingenuous and not fully transparent. For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water's direction is reversed. Reservoirs produce methane, a process that is not well understood. I understand the need for new forms of power but this is not the clean, environmentally-friendly power intended, and the damage to local economies and ecosystems far outweighs potential benefit. 
 
Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from go forward.
