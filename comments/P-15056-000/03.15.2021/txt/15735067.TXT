Selina E Guendel, BOICEVILLE, NY.
Hello, 
My name is Selina and I am a Catskills native. Having grown up and still living near the shores of the Ashokan in Boiceville, I am proud of the natural wonders we have in the town of Olive. This was only recently further highlighted by the new Ashokan Rail Trail. I think it would be a grave mistake and danger to the landscape we all love and the natural beauty that supports many by brining tourism to the area, by allowing Premium Energy to move forward with their Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (docket P-15056). I hope you will consider denying the permit for a feasibility study. This Californian company should have no right to impact and profit off of the landscape without taking into account the impact on those who live and recreate here.
Thank you,
Selina
