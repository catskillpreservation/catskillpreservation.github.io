Eleanor Lundeen, Phoenicia, NY.
As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

This project is an example of over-development in lands that are valued as bucolic and serving the hunting, fishing and recreational interest of millions of people who live and vacation here. 

Funds for a project such as this would be better used to change and improve current energy production plants. Funds would also be better used to improve more efficient use of energy by individual customers. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
