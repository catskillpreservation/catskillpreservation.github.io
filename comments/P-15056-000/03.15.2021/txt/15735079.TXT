Alice Beresin, Chichestwe, NY.
Docket P-15056-000

As a resident of Chichester, NY, I am writing to express my opposition to the hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashoken Reservoir and request FERC to deny Premiu, Energy Holding's application for a permit. This project will call great harm to our land and water.

Sincerely,

Alice Beresin
