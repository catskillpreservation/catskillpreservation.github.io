I am a life long resident of the Mid Hudson Valley area and I am a big fan of this project as presented thus far. I am interested in more information about it, but the idea of using underground structures to use the existing reservoir to produce green hydroponic energy is a great one and very exciting. I would love to see information on how this will be done and for the company to put out information on how the money spent for this project can be funneled into the local economy through using local resources or companies. Overall, a very interesting proposal and a very exciting one. I am in support of the project.
