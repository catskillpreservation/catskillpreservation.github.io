The Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek are each special places to me, either fishing in the Esopus, walking or riding the rail trails, it is my favorite place to be.  The beauty of the entire area is amazing. I have rediscovered fly fishing, and feel grateful to have one of the best trout streams in the state so close.  The thought of disrupting the fishing and the area is heart breaking.  I understand clean energy is important, but this is not the place, there is too much at risk.

Thank you, 
Mike
