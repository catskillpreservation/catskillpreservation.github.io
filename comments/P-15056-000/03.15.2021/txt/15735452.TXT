Courtney M. Williams, PhD, Peekskill, NY.
docket number P-15056-000

My name is Courtney Williams. I am a resident of Peekskill, NY, but my family has a camp in Big Indian, NY and frequent in Shandaken and the area around the Ashokan Reservoir.

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holding's plan to flood more of the area for their project.

Shandaken has already been forever altered by the formation of the Ashokan Reservoir, displacing entire communities to flood them to serve New York City.

This community objects to this project and their wishes should be respected. 

As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
