Elaine Fasula, Shokan, NY.
As a resident in the town of Olive for the past 22yrs. I have learned that the proposed hydroelectric project will be installed in our community.
I strongly object to this proposal as it would be an intrusive damage to our local lands, streams and ruin the drinking water source for millions of New Yorkers.
Docket number P-15056-000
