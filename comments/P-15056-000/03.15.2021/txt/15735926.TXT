Linda Michela, Phoenicia, NY.
As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.  Since my home is less than half a mile from where they propose to put one of their reservoirs, I would imagine the impact to my life would be huge, unless they plan on taking my home under eminent domain, which would be devastating to myself and my family.
