Matthew, Phoenicia, NY.
     Hello, I am vehemently opposed to this  project. The impact this would have on these mountains and waters is heartbreaking to consider. I have chosen to live here and  raise my children here because of the access to good water. This project would directly threaten our well being. It is deeply irresponsible and completely unnecessary to be drilling through and constructing on these beautiful life giving mountains. As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I will fight this project tooth and nail. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Thank you - Matthew Oâ€™Neill
