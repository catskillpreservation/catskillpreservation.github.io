This project would be a great error. This site and area are pristine woodland and villages. We donâ€™t want any hydro- electric project in this area or anywhere nearby. Plus this is in the New York City watershed. No contamination here.   Perhaps work could be done with a existing electric plants. Do NOT build, tunnel, or cut trees here.
