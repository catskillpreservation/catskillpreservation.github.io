Susan Perrin, Olivebridge, NY.
As a resident of Olive, a town that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I VIGOROUSLY OBJECT to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission DENY Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 
The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. We live here and our land should not be sold for destructive purposes and to profit a company with no ties to this area other than to extract resources. 
PLEASE do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
Thank you.
Regards,
Susan Perrin
