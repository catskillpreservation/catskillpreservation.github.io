Tiffany Barringer, West Shokan, NY.

Hey you, 

In regards to Docket Number P-15056-000, I, Tiffany Barringer, of the hamlet of West Shokan, strongly oppose.

I invite you to take a moment. Let your mind wander to a place nearby that you go to often that brings you peace. Could be your porch, backyard, the woods, a park, the desert, vacation area, anywhere. These spaces exist, everywhere, whether you are in California or New York City. You have one too. Imagine yourself there. Relive the moments, the memories, the feelings. You are happy. Truly happy. 

Now imagine a stranger sneaking in- and destroying it. The very place you love, the memories stored deep in your mind, in your soul. The one place you feel truly happy. 
Gone.  
Now what do you feel?

There are some things that money cannot buy.

Please, I ask that you, whoever you are, take the time to personally reach out and get to know the local people of the area you have plans to affect. This is our home. I truly believe that if we work together, then there is hope that we can all find a way to make everyone happy. 

Feel free to start with me. My e-mail is Tifferz728@gmail.com and I would love to chat anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.  

Thanks.
