Karen Lee, Chichester, NY.
I have recently become a full time resident of Chichester, NY, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.  The Catskills is an area of pristine beauty and every effort needs to be taken to preserve what nature has provided to us for generations to come.  It would be an environmental tragedy beyond proportion if a project such as the above project was to proceed.  I absolutely oppose this project.
