Jennifer Ogg, Kingston, NY.
I am a resident of Olivebridge, however our mailing address is Kingston. We live very close to the Ashokan reservoir with my parents and young daughter. We stand in opposition of the proposal for the pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant. We fear the ecological and environmental impact it will have on the area as well as the displacement of residents in the area. We strongly urge you to reject their proposal for the sake of humanity. Thank you.
