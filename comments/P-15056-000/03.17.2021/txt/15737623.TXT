RE: Docket P-15056

     As a resident of Olive for 27 years whose property is on both sides of the Mettacahonts Creek, I realize the fragility of our precious eco- system and strongly oppose this unnecessary hydro project. The amount of digging and construction in the fragile area proposed would permanently dislodge wildlife, the flora and fauna and countless other forms of life.  
   The Catskills are rich with many smaller streams that are part of the Hudson Valley watershed that are always running. These could easily support a host of micro hydro projects installed by individual home owners that could provide reliable electricity to the area.  
    This project is a bad idea for this area and I strongly oppose it.
