Paula Dutcher, Shokan, NY.
As a resident of Olive, I strictly oppose the granting of the permit to Premier Energy Holdings in the case of approving a feasibility study to build a dam and powerhouse in the area. The proposed construction by Premier Energy Holdings will displace and disrupt local residents and destroy the beautiful and thriving natural environment. Furthermore, Turbidity and contaminants will likely taint the drinking water of the millions of residents of New York City, which is provided by the Ashokan Reservoir - the area under scope by Premier Energy Holdings. Please do not approve this permit application.
