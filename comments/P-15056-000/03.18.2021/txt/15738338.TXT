Sean Mahoney, Tannersville, NY.
As a resident of the Town of Hunter, I would like to make it known that there has been no official communication between this project and its owners and our local municipality. From what i can tell from the proposal, this project would eliminate a large portion of the Hamlet of Lanesville within the Town of Hunter. We have numerous residents that would be impacted by this development, as well as a State Highway 214 which appears would have to be moved.

At this time, I ask that the local municipality the Town of Hunter be notified and brought into the fold of what is being proposed within our Town Borders. We want full transparency and facts presented on All of the impacts that this project would bring to our Town. 

Thank you,

Sean Mahoney
