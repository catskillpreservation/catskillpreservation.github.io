Nancy Golladay, Phoenicia, NY.
We own a home in one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. This project would take place less than 2 miles from our Woodland Valley property. We need constant access to this house, as, being senior citizens, we shelter there during COVID spikes in the greater NY area. I strongly object to the proposal. It defies common sense. I ask that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. Their proposed for-profit project is likely to damage local homes, roads, bridges, and streams in the area, plus denying local merchants and workers their much-needed seasonal income from tourism, skiing, and sport fishing. The increased turbidity in waters will also threaten the unfiltered drinking water source for 9,000,000+ residents of New York City. Therefore, the project benefits no one in NY State except its investors, if any such exist outside of PEH's California-based business. Please do everything possible to stop this ill-conceived proposal now.
