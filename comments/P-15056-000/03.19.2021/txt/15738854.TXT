Eric Ansanelli, Hunter, NY.
Hello,

There appear to be material errors in an Amendment filed to this docket dated January 21, 2021; the amendment is identified with a document accession number: "20210201-5022" for FERC project number 15056. In the aforementioned document section titled "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY 18 C.F.R. § 4.32(a)" it is stated: "Every city, town or similar local political subdivision:
(A) In which any part of the project, and any Federal facilities that would be used by the project, would be located" and DOES NOT go on to identify the county, town, or locality of Lanesville, NY, located in the Town of Hunter in Greene County, where the same document proposes a 245-acre reservoir and associated dam.

The wetted footprint of the proposed reservoir, shown later in Exhibit 3 of the same document, would include a small rural town center and the sole arterial road (NY-214) that provides access to the residents of the Stony Clove valley, including my business. To the extent of my knowledge, neither the residents of the directly affected and adjacent areas nor the leadership at the town and county level have been informed of this proposal. 

This reservoir would require the removal or destruction of currently-occupied homes and places of business and it would have direct adverse impact on my business. The community members have not been given their due as stakeholders.

Sincerely,

Eric Ansanelli
