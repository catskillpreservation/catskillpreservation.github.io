Cindy Flamenhaft, West Hurley, NY.
This is a massive project that is being proposed in a quiet, residential area which is being over-run with corporations looking to cash in on the beautiful lands and natural resources. It is obviously a concern to local residents. Unfortunately, due to poor planning, tonightâ€™s meeting was set up on a platform that could only accommodate 100 participants. Many tried to join but could not. Therefore, additional public forums should be created.
