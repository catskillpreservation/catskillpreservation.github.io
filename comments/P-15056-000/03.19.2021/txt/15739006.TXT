Maxine Davidowitz, West Shokan, NY.
I have learned that your company has proposed a feasibility study for a pumped storage facility in the Ashokan reservoir region and I must strenuously object. The region you are considering bringing this to is a State Forest Preserve with the highest possible protective status (Status One) as designated by the USGS. You should have been aware of that from the outset, and so I wonder at the potential for other flaws in your proposal. The region is one of the rarest preserves in New York State of natural forest, with protected wildlife, flora and fauna. This is a rural area with small narrow roads, as well, and any construction through this region would be completely unfeasable. I have very deep concerns about this destructive proposal, and I will make my opinion known to all parties involved.
