It is ridiculous that a company from another state is proposing something that the community hasn't asked for or needs.  My understanding is that the facility itself will generate 2800 MW but only 800MW go to the community, which I assume we will have to pay for via our electric bill.  My other understanding is that the other 2000MW will be used to run the facility. What is our community to gain??  There will be a huge disruption to the community and ecology of the area. For what?  It can be assumed that this intruding company will somehow make a profit on the back of our community.  Essentially:  How dare they..??
