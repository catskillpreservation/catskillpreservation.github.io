Skye Owens, Chichester, NY.
The areas where these proposed sites exist are all on private land meaning the destroying of property and revenue driving activities for our towns and local businesses.
We rely on tourism dollars in the Catskills such as hiking, snow sports, hunting, fishing, fly fishing, geo studies, educational camps, and scenic byways like 214 through Lanesville.
Please reconsider this project on NY STATE LAND, not private property.
