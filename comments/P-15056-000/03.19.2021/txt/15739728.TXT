Hi, my name is Oksana Nichols. I have 
Been a full time resident at 2303 State Rt 28A, Olivebridge, NY 12461 for the past 17 years. This is one of the most unique places in NYS. Besides being beautiful in any time of the year, its home to some protected species, like timber rattle snakes, bold eagles, eastern hognose snake, bog orchid. Many local creeks and brooks are both trout waters and trout spawning habitats. The Ashokan pumped storage project / FERC project # P-15056 is deficient since it is not a closed loop project, as it involves addition of another reservoir, this project is deceitful and potentially comes in direct conflict with The US Constitution, as the area proposed for the development in FERC project # P-15056 is part of Catskills Forrest Preserve, created by Constitution in 1885. The Ashokan pumped water storage project will increase the turbidity of the water, thus decreasing the quality of the drinking water NYS wide, and affecting trout natural environment. Please, do not allow FERC project # P-15056 go any further and do not grant preliminary license.
