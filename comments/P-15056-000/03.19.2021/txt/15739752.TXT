Amy Barkow, Phoenicia, NY.
As a part-time resident of the Woodland Valley in Phoenicia, NY (one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity), I categorically object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do everything in its power to deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, expensive and unnecessary. If allowed to proceed, it will destroy or cause longterm damage to local lands, streams and native wildlife, require massive road and infrastructural reconstruction and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for more than nine million people in New York City. I strongly oppose this proposal and urge the FERC to do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.​
