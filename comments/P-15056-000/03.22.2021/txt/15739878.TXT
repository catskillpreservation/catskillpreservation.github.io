K. Clark, New York, NY.
I am a NYC resident and I am very concerned this project would affect the drinking water for me and 9 million neighbors.  Our water supply is not an experiment.  
As a NY State resident, I am concerned that this project is being proposed by an out of state corporation seeking to make a profit, without taking into consideration the lives and health and homes of NYS and NYC residents.
While I understand, and applaud, an effort to inquire into green energy solutions, that cannot come at the cost of tainting our water supply.  
Please do not approve this project.
