Dear Governor Cuomo:

There is a proposal, which is part of the Premium Energy Proposal,  to build a new, 225-acre reservoir and dam running 1/2 mile long in West Shokan.    Much of the construction would be underground, but itâ€™s unclear to me whether there would be blasting and depredation of the visual environment were the dam to be approved. The environment here is the chief reason my late wife and I moved here 24 years ago. 
 
I received a flyer from a local group with whom I usually have few dealings, so the actual impact of the project is unclear to me. I note that property values here have soared in recent months, and the question needs to be asked whether the destructive effects on real estate values and the environment (the project abuts hiking trails and state campgrounds) will equal the economic gain from additional electricity.  Houses here that were worth $150,000 two years ago are now worth $400,000. The demand for outdoor recreation has also soared.
 
The city has a history, which goes back 120 years, of pursuing projects of benefit to the city without concern for costs to the Town of Olive.   I doubt that the costs have been accurately assessed, nor is it clear what the environmental damage will be, nor is it clear that the funds will be available to complete a long-term project.
 
Sincerely
 

Mitchell Langbert
