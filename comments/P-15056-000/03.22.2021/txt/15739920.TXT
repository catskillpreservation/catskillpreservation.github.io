I have lived in the Ashokan Reservoir area for over 40 years. While I have seen many changes, there is one feature that endures.  The Ashokan Reservoir remains a spectacular natural habitat for many species - while some are endangered all of them matter.  Most important, the habitat endures as a natural haven only a hundred miles from one of the worldâ€™s great metropolitan areas; and is a symbol to our commitment to the environment. This habitat then goes on to effortlessly provide clean, quality, pure water to that city of 9 plus million.  While Pumped Storage facilities offer promise and while it is an emerging technology, the Ashokan Reservoir is the wrong site for this.This will be a massive project and will disrupt and destroy this very valuable habitat, regardless of the assurances anyone can provide.  I voice my opposition to this project.
