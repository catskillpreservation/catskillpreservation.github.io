The Proposed Hydroelectric Plant at the Ashokan Reservoir is a poorly thought out attempt at producing sustainable energy. Premium Energy have not provided
enough information on this project to warrant hand waving of any part of their
proposal. To create an inefficient hydroelectric plant that must pump water uphill to yield energy in the first place is a poor plan. On top of this, building on status 1 land is just inviting a legal battle that could end up delaying this project for a long time. If the state of New York wants to get sustainable energy to its citizens right away, then why try to take land that will require an amendment to the New York State constitution, which protects the Catskills. With Joe Biden now president, there is a solid chance that nuclear power plants in the state of New York will have the funding to reopen sometime in the next four years. In addition to this, wind and solar can easily be substituted with a much smaller environmental impacts on one of New York's greatest treasures. The untouched Catskills region is the primary reason that I, as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, visit and spend money in the state of New York. Please take time to solicit more reasonable and thought out sustainable energy proposals before rushing into any attempts to fundamentally alter the Catskills region.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read my comment,
