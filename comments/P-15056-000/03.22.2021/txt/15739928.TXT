This proposal is almost laughable.  All of the proposed sites are status 1 land which should be avoided per DOE.  Further, any development in this area would require an amendment to the NYS Constitution.  The region in question has already suffered due to the extensive network of NYC drinking water reservoirs.  Further, this are is used extensively for recreational pursuits, including hiking, camping, fishing and hunting.  In a state as densely populated as NY, eliminating land suitable for such activities should always be a last resort.
