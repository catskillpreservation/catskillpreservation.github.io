Justine Hookes, Bearsville, NY.
As someone who lives near to and visits the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that FERC deny the application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, terribly invasive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, causing increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. I wholeheartedly support alternative and renewable energy sources, but this project is not the right one for this region. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. Many thanks for your time and consideration.
