The Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s proposed Ashokan hydroelectric project does is not well suited for the Catskills and the Ashokan reservoir.  Nine million NYC residents depend upon the reservoir for their drinking water.  It is not something that should be put in jeopardy.  The project would also be disruptive to local ecosystems.  The beauty of the Catskills brings many of us to the area to recreate and contributes to the economy in the region.  Just last week it was announced that the Catskills Park would receive funds for maintaining it as the treasured resource that it is.  Please reject the application for a preliminary permit.
