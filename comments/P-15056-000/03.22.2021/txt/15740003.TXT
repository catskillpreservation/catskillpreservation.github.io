Lauren Kelley, Portland, OR.
As a former New Yorker who owned a home about eight miles from the Ashokan Reservoir and hopes to live near there again soon, I am shocked and disappointed at the thoughtlessness of the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. I have hiked and swam in the Woodland Valley, and attended a square dance (SERIOUSLY, a square dance) at a wonderful gathering place for a group of homes that have been owned by families for a hundred years.  Energy creation by flooding areas that are protected, vital, and carefully enjoyed is not a solution. I object to this proposal's shortsightedness, environmental destruction, construction impact, and risk to the area's watershed (not to mention to the residents of NYC who drink this water). Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
