The proposed pumped storage project is not the best way to provide storage capacity. 

The project is within Catskill State Park.  This is a scenic resource. Residents of the Hudson Valley are very aware of the Storm King pumped storage proposal, which was defeated. Resistance is already gathering.

Other technologies exist to fill this need. Edison battery (nickel-iron) storage was recently put forward as an alternative to an unsuccessful local gas fired peak power plant proposal.  These larger batteries are safer than lithium batteries, so a facility can be the same size as a lithium storage facility which requires spacing of units for fire safety. Several Edison battery storage buildings could be sited around the electrical grid to provide this capacity, even though their energy storage density is not as large as a pumped storage facility. 

Pumped storage reservoirs are not viable living habitats, as they are drained when used, and the contents fed through turbines.  The remaining biomass would be deposited into a drinking water reservoir to decay.   The Ashokan reservoir already has faced water quality problems, which require watershed management regulations, and is now facing sediment management trouble in the lower Esopus.
