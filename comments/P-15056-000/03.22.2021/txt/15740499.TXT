Carole Huppert, West Shokan, NY.
As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 
 
I do understand and appreciate the need to create more truly renewable energy sources. We cannot allow typical NIMBY concerns to block all projects. 
 
However, this proposal is truly deficient, would cause massive and irreparable harm to protected lands and to people, and should be denied on its merits. The proposed sites in the Catskills region are on Status 1 land, and the Department of Energy has clearly stated that Status 1 or 2 land must be avoided for any development. The proposed project will cause severe ecological damage, particularly on streams resulting in increased turbidity and sediment in water that serve as an unfiltered drinking water source and blocking the natural spawning areas of trout and other wildlife.
 
Furthermore, the proposed project is not a true ‘closed loop” energy source and is not the type of innovation that is being sought; it could even result in a net loss of energy given its reliance on traditional pumping to higher elevations. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I respectfully ask that you prevent this proposal from moving forward.
