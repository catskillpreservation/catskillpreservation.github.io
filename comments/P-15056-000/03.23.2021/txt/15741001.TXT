William McKnight Sr., West Hurley, NY.
To whom it may concern,
As a local resident who walks, hikes, and enjoys fishing in the upper and lower Esopus creek as well as in the Ashokan reservoir, it seems hard to believe FERC would even propose such a disastrous project and flood even more homes and properties in the Catskills. It is very clear that this proposed project would displace residents, destroy natural habitat, and create an unwelcome ecological disaster within the Catskill watershed. The “power plant” as designed would warm the waters of the Ashokan Reservoir to the extent that the trout population would dwindle, and the habitat would be severely harmed.
I vigorously oppose this proposed project and request that the Federal Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. This proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed will likely render our beautiful area with irreparable damage and cause turbidity in waters that serve as unfiltered water to millions of people in New York City. Please deny the permit request and tell the applicant this is not the right location for this proposed project.
