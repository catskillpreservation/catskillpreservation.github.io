Scott H See, KINGSTON, NY.
I live on and own property directly on the proposed 500 kv AC T/L. How will you be able to proceed with any structures if no residents are willing to allow you to build on their land? I am also greatly concerned about the dams having an effect on the resevoir and resevoir ecosystem. So you want to build a hydro electric station with the same reservoir you supply all of NYC's water? That sounds kinda dangerous if anything were to go wrong in any stages of the project as well as during operation. The Ashokan reservoir is a beautiful place and the surrounding areas are amazing yet your proposing to destroy some of it for more power? Most the residents out here want solar so this would benefit whom? I for one am against any kind of development within the area, ESPECIALLY within my own immediate area. My fiancee and I purposely bought this house and property specifically to get away from the grid without being off it completely. The last thing we want is ANY kind of power lines or structures anywhere within eyesight...
