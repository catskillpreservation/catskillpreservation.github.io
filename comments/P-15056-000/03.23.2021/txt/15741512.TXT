 Please require Premium Energy to, at the very least, resubmit their application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As I'm sure you're aware, their proposal is not a closed loop system, as represented, and as I'm sure you're also aware, there are numerous other factual errors in their application. It goes without saying that such an enormous project should have meticulous planning and attention to detail prior to submission.
 This project, if ultimatly allowed to go forward (at any level) would have a negative impact of such magnitude effecting countless entities, that the result will be immediate and continuous pushback and never ending litigation. In my opinion, it will become increasingly obvious that Premium Energy didn't spend the time  and effort necessarty for proper proposal of such a plan and its location.
This is simply not the place for this project. I believe this will become increasingly obvious, to the extent this plan is allowed to go forward. I am also  of the belief, based on my experience of 45 years as a trial attorney and from what I've seen thus far here (both from Premium Energy's initial application and the resulting reaction to same in the short time it's been public) that ultimately this project will not go forward in this location. How much time and money end up wasted remains to be seen.
Respectfully submitted,
Robert T. Krause, Esq.
