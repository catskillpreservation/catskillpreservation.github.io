I have concerns about the impacts of the proposed dams that are part of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  I see no information concerning the impacts of a dam on the fish in the stream that will be dammed nor any indications that the dam will be designed to not impact local fisheries.  Also, I have seen indications that the increased inflow to the Ashokan Reservoir will cause increased turbidity.  The turbidity of the water in the reservoir is already a cause for concern as it impacts the lower Esopus Creek. 
 
Our area is known for outdoor activities, especially trout fishing.  Any damage to the environment, especially to the streams, will have impacts on the ecology and the economy of the region.  Once any damage is caused by construction such as with dams, it is difficult to recover from.  The impacts need to be fully assessed and discussed before any permitting is allowed.
