Jennifer Vallance, Shokan, NY.
I value the environment and hope to seek out renewable energy sources but do not think this is in the best interest of the Town.  I raised a few concerns with FERC re: the impact on the quality of the water and the surrounding land.  Each member, all from different departments, indicated that “can be a concern”.  If they feel that way, then it is of deep concern to me as I’m sure it must be to the millions of people who live in NYC (as this is the main source of their water supply).

In addition, the proposal of additional, yet smaller, reservoirs bothers me for the simple fact that we already have several flood zones in the area and have gone to great time and expense to avoid the potential for flooding.  Over time and with the potential for erosion mentioned in several of FERC’s studies, I can only see this as a problematic area that will need to be addressed down the line.

Additionally, the State has gone to great expense to provide the Rail Trail which draws great crowds during all four seasons of the year.  Offering hiking, biking, etc. and the observation of many species of birds and other animals (some nearing extinction or on the wildlife protection list).  A project such as this will surely be a disruption to them in their natural habitat.

I think most people agree we all want to preserve the planet we share but it is hard to justify doing it this way when the health of many may suffer, the natural habitat may disappear and all that is beautiful about this area will be torn apart in the process.
