I write as a resident of Olive that I am concerned about the proposed placement of the hydro electric dam and power plant. From my understanding, this project will have a significant negative environmental and ecological effect on lands, at least partially, protected by New York’s Constitution. See Article XIV, Section 1, of the New York Constitution (“The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.”) How many trees will be decimated in these beautiful Catskills mountains to string high voltage power lines and the bulldozing for a reservoir.

What remains of the wild must be protected. The natural beauty of these mountains draws  thousands of visitors from all over the world to these small communities, thus helping sustain our small businesses. Any kind of massive construction project, such as the proposed plan, should be looked at with strict scrutiny. 

This application should be denied.
