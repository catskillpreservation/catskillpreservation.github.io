Marisa Ann Perez Rogers, Shokan, NY.
We live in the Town of Olive, Village of Shokan, We greatly oppose this Hydro electric plant construction project in the town of Olive.  We recreate often and regularly throughout the area, this would be devastating to our scenic way of life as well as a detriment to wildlife and surrounding habitats.
please decline their proposal for this power plant.  
thank you!
