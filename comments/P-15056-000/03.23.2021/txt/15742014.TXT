Pumped Storage Electrical Generating Systems consume MORE electricity than they produce.  It takes more energy to pump water to the upper reservoir than is produced when the water flows back downhill.  The advantage to pumped storage is that the electricity costs less to move the water uphill because that happens typically at night when electricity demand is low.  The electricity produced when the water flows down is more valuable because that happens when electrical demand is high. Pumped storage can be a net producer of electricity only if a stream or river adds water to the upper reservoir.

The advantage to pumped storage besides the economics for the electric company is that it is more reliable since wind or sunlight are not factors like in "green" generating systems.

To build a pumped storage system would require dams, reservoirs and tunnels.  The disruption and habitat loss, as well as monetary cost, is not justified.
