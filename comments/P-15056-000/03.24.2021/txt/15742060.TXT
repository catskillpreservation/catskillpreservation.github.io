I live in West Shokan, NY. I’m curious to know what started the interest in the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. I would like to see the Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) reports. There are several bald eagle nesting sites located along the Ashokan reservoir and in the areas for the 3 proposed reservoirs, what will be done to protect them and other wildlife? Why are  the transmission lines running on the southern side of the Ashokan Reservoir, instead of along NYS Route 28 on the northern side? Why do the proposed facilities need to be located 200-300 feet below ground level? Will the building of this effect the well water systems of local residents? How much noise, traffic disruption, dust, etc. can we expect from the construction of this? Since this will be underground, how much blasting will there be? Or will mining equipment be used used and if so, what type will be brought in? Will local labor be used or is this a private out-of-state company’s labor force? Once it’s built, who owns it and maintains it?
