The community that exists in the stony Clove and Woodland  Valleys and in Olive / Shokan will raise hell and WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. Take the project somewhere else and save the trouble. 

We will protect our rivers and streams from PROFIT DRIVEN EXPLOTATION which will destroy not only our life styles and primary sources of joy but WILDLIFE that exists in a balanced ecosystem ONLY HERE because of the undisrupted natural expanse that is the Catskills.  

This project is NOT SUITED for the Catskills in anyway and FERC and Premium Energy Holdings can take it somewhere else where it will benefit the people. We DON'T NEED OR WANT IT HERE AND WONT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.
