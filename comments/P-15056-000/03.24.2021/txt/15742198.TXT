I think this is a very unfair, unacceptable idea. I live here and swim in the river almost every day of every summer. It would make it extremely dangerous and risky to swim in it if at any time a huge rush of water could come sweeping down and take a human with it. If you do this these rivers, and streams won't be very accesible to the people that live here. Please take everything into consideration before you do this.
