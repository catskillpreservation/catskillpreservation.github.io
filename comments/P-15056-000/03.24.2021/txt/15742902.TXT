To whom it may concern :

I am writing to you as a concerned Woodland Valley resident, who is against the proposed  underground hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir by the company Premium Energy Holdings LLC.

The  proposed locations for the new reservoirs would mean taking away private property from people and in one case – for the prospective WoodlandReservoir – involve flooding an entire community, Woodland Valley, which is the community that I live in. Additionally, this proposed plant poses potential issues with town infrastructure, individual wells, regional infrastructure as related to the electric grid, and environmental sensitivities.

We do not want this plant coming to our beautiful and protected environment here in the Catskill Mountain Region!

With respect,
Mandana Boushee
