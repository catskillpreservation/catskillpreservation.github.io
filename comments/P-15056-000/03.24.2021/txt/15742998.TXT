The plant would utilize electricity to pump water to the upper reservoir.  This is inefficient and hardly innovation.  The public deserves a higher standard for an energy project.

The area is used for recreation.   The disruption of construction and the lasting impact on the natural resources in the area would have unforeseen economic impact.

Construction, ongoing operation, and potential accidents would have devastating impact on the aquatic environment in the immediate and surrounding areas.  This is totally unacceptable considering the history of the aquatic environment and its economic potential. 

The proposed area is on Status 1 land and would require legislative effort at the state level to move forward.
