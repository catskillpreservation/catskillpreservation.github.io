Danielle M Bliss, Shokan, NY.
I don't want this in my community. The last thing we need are cancer causing high voltage transmission lines running anywhere near my house, where I hike or near any of the schools. This will bring a lot of damage to protected forests and wildlife. This area is home to many eagles and birds of prey. I did not buy a home in Shokan to be near a destructive power plant. And I would love to know why a company from California is the one proposing this. It sounds like even local environmental agencies were not notified of this proposal.
