To whom it concerns:

I am writing about Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric plant in the Catskills. I live next to the Catskills and know the area well, as I hike in there every week. I know all three proposed locations. I am shocked at the choices, as they are all manifestly unsuitable for a project of this kind. 

Premium Energy’s proposal seems haphazard and sloppy and quickly put together without any real knowledge of the area, of the obvious impacts this project will have on this major tourism area, or of the laws that apply to these projects and the Catskill Park.

1. The Catskill Park is constitutionally protected as “forever wild" and is highy preserved Status 1 Land. The Department of Energy has said that Status 1 or 2 must be avoided for development. Premium Energy seem unaware that their project will require an amendment to the State Constitution which protects the Catskill Park. 

2. This region is where fly fishing began in the United States and this project threatens to destroy that valuable legacy with sediment build-up which will decimate local trout habitat.

3. This project not kind of innovation DoE is looking for. This is not a true “closed loop” project. Premium Energy’s proposal is deficient. It does not deserve the streamlined application process.

Thank you for your consideration of these points.
