Basis for Intervening:
Motion to Intervene of Dawn Peters for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, 
Project No. P-15056

As a resident in an impacted community and as a taxpayer in that community, Chichester in Ulster County, the State of New York, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will undoubtedly impact environmental resources and state constitutionally protected public land that I have a stakeholder interest in as a contributing taxpayer. 

The proposed Stoney Clove dam, located in Lanesville, would be approximately 1.25 miles north of my home and Stoney Clove Creek streamside property. This CEMENT BARRIER would be 2,600 feet in length and 212 feet high. EFFECTIVELY CHOKING the Stoney Clove Creek and altering the streambank and aquatic habitat of any plant or animal living in this cold water stream.

In light of the uncertainties of global warming, NO FEASIBILITY STUDY NOR COMPUTER MODELLING can predict the added consequences of a construction site and eventual dam, tunnels, high tension wires, turbines, etc., on the delicate balance of nature we have here in the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Forests act as a filter. This natural filter keeps NYC's unfiltered drinking water system clean by preventing the runoff of chemicals and soil into waterways and eventually the upper Ashokan Reservoir, which already holds years of silt, sediment, etc. Locally, the dam would undoubtedly impact the area's water table, wells, MY WELL, stream turbidity, and ultimately, it would have to affect NYC's drinking water quality. Stoney Clove Creek, a source of life and sustenance, would inevitably be forever changed. 

I, Dawn Peters, respectfully request that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings. 

Respectfully submitted,
Dawn Peters
