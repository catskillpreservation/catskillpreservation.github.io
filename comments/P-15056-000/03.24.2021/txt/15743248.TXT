Louis and Carol Mauriello, Chichester, NY.
We understand the fact that the government has requirements to take appropriate action(s) for our future electric needs, and we understand the government’s thoughts that green energy style so-called renewable energy sources are considered the future.

The following are our concerns with this project’s three proposed locations:
•	Lanesville – This site is the farthest equating to the causing the most environmental damage running the pipeline through Phoenicia, Chichester, and Stoney Clove. It also involves the longest run of pipeline, which will make it the most expensive to operate insofar as the energy required to pump water from the Ashokan Reservoir to the Upper Reservoir, negating any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	Woodland Valley - Though Woodland Valley is much closer, by half the distance of Lanesville, it posses a very similar environmental damage issue, plus seems to eliminate access to the State campground and hiking trails which are a major attraction and revenue generator for the area.
•	Both the Lanesville and the Woodland Valley sites would require the pipeline extend through the Route 28 Corridor causing more environmental damage, raise the costs of pumping the water, and will further negate any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	MoonHaw Road – This site seems the best possible choice. It would involve the least amount of environmental damage and the least amount of pipeline, which would decrease the costs of pumping water, though I haven’t seen any data on at what length pumping becomes financially worthwhile.
•	All three locations would require further environmental damage for the power lines and connections to the grid the project requires.

We are also concerned about the overall environmental impact of this project and how it will affect the Ashokan Reservoir’s ecosystem as well as the ecosystems of the Esopus and other creeks, all of which need extensive study before a decision like this should be considered. Plus, the government needs to study the possible impact this could have on the downstate needs of NYC residents as it will have an impact on their drinking water supply. Furthermore, the entire Catskill Park Forest Preserve, of which this project falls within, could be drastically affected and will require extensive study to determine the impacts.

As stated in the bullets above, pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir to another reservoir, by design, can only consume more energy than it creates, and we question where the energy to perform all that pumping is coming from as it sounds like it will require more fossil fuel utilization, not less.

As a last point, we understand that the concern over whether green energy investments reduce the costs of electricity to its citizens aren’t always a determining factor in government decisions, but this project goes beyond that consideration as, previously stated, it would all take place within the Blue Line of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve and be devastating to the ecosystem. As such, this project seems more appropriate for State land along the Hudson river where connecting to grid infrastructure would be much easier, cause less damage to the environment, and be part of a hydro ecosystem that is much more robust than the Esopus feed to the Ashokan reservoir will ever be.

In closing, we thank you for your consideration of our concerns and comments.

Respectfully,

Louis and Carol Mauriello
