christopher diamond, East Jewett, NY.
Hello. I am a resident of Jewett NY (northern Catskills) and Brooklyn NY. I am writing to voice my opposition to this proposal. I initially started researching this project because I'm interested in pumped storage as a critical component of our clean energy future, and I would normally vocally support such a project to combat the NIMBY attitude. But I cannot support this project for a number of reasons. 
Primarily, this project would attempt to take state land within the Blue Line of the Catskills State Park which has been designated as forever wild. (I don't understand the legal mechanisms by which they could take this land without a state-wide referendum in addition to a vote by two consecutive sessions of our state legislature.) 
Secondly, this project would undoubtedly increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir. Turbidity is already a big issue for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the city's water department.
This is the right project but in the WRONG location.
I truly support pumped-storage projects. (I work in environmental sustainability and climate resilience so I understand the issues.) But this is not the right location. Other projects that  (1) do not rely on protected state lands and (2) do not threaten the NYC drinking water system should be considered. If such a project comes forward, I will gladly support it in opposition to the NIMBY movement.
-Chris
