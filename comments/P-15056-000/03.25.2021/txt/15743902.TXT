The Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal is not beneficial for this area or community. I am a town of Olive resident I grew up in Shandaken.  I am a property owner as well as a business owner in this area. This proposal is not displaying any benefit to this community. Only negative effects for the people and profits for a company that isn't based in New York.  It is a California based company coming into upstate New York to make money and destroy our community and lands. Coming into the area and acting like it is ok to relocate families in a time where people cannot find homes to live. This demonstrates the lack of care for our community. Hiding under the umbrella of renewable energy is unacceptable and creating a false vision of what it will do for our community. I am against this proposal. During the town board presentation a question was asked what's in it for the community the company representative replied it is renewable energy. They are not looking out for us the residents of this community they are looking out for their bottom line. One of the reasons we all live here is because of the community and lands. Allowing an organization to destroy our lands and potentially remove families from our community is unacceptable.
