Mary M Schroeder, Lanesville, NY.
I am a resident of Lanesville NY, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a new dam and reservoir.  I am requesting the Federal Energy Regulatory commission deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit.  The project would destroy our life here.  The community here, our land and house would be destroyed.  Our neighbors would all lose their houses and our way of life here would come to an end. In addition to the destruction of this historic community, the trails, streams and woods would be obliterated.  And how in the world would this be a good idea for the drinking water of New York City?
