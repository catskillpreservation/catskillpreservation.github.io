Its hard to ignore the devastating impacts on the natural environment that this pumped-storage power plant will have. For one thing, as this PowerPoint is more than happy to inform us, the building of an upper-level reservoir will "wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats" but also "[destroy] valuable trout breeding habitat" (slide 26, Strand). As a matter of fact, the only benefits to building this plant that are ever outlined have little to no impact on the local residents surrounding the reservoir. The only benefits to this project are economical, and they only economically benefit New York City and the companies who are building it. 

I implore concerned individuals, activists, and anybody living around here to read that PowerPoint and ask yourself "what will this do for me?" The answer is, quite simply, nothing. 

My concern with this project is that the negative environmental and economic impacts of it will be bared only by the local people, and that this is yet another frightening example of a government overstepping their boundaries to make up for a lack of adequately and sustainably designed city infrastructure. The PowerPoint provided on the Town of Olive website does nothing to dissuade me from that.
