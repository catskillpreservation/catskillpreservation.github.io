Re: Preliminary Permit Application
Proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project and Ashokan Reservoir-Power Plant Proposal
495209905


3/25/2021


To whom it may concern,

This letter is to register my vigorous opposition to the above proposed Permit and project!
This proposal includes an inappropriate siting of  a large dammed reservoir in a NYS forest, an underground hydro plant in West Shokan and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the town of Ulster. ALL IN THE CATSKILL STATE PARK and surrounding area. 

The idea of this project in a pristine natural environment, where tourism is a major source of income for our communities, is absolutely unacceptable!

This California company is arbitrarily choosing sites all over the country for investment, without regard to the impact on our community.

The town of Olive has already suffered a loss of income from the building of the Ashokan reservoir and we, as residents, are required to comply with strict and extra costly regulations in order to keep New York City's water supply fresh and clean.

Though I am a supporter of clean energy, there must be consideration for appropriate locations.

Please deny them this permit and keep them, and anyone else, from building projects that would desecrate our natural environment.


Sincerely,


Pierre Heijnen
