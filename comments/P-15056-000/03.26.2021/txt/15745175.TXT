This proposal lacks in grounding or merit to it's proposed location. I'm not sure if Premium Energy Holdings, LLC is simply throwing darts at a map right now, as that's the only possible way anybody could think a project like this would belong in this location:

1. On a general note power production is not a concern for the area to be met. We have issues as any rural area does with outages, but those are all from storms that disrupt the infrastructure, never from demand outpacing supply.
2. In order to build any of the proposals it would not simply mean imminent domain problems for residents and land owners but also getting land from the State of New York who holds land in all of the proposed areas, so they would be taking public land at the expense of every single resident in the state.
3. The Esopus Creek has just been given designation as a river of Wild-Quality by New York Department of Conservation.

This is pretty clearly a plow to fund a feasibility study for somebody to profit, but to never intend on pursing, because anybody in the area can tell you it's not feasible.
