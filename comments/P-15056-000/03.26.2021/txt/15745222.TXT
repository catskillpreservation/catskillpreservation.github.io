The proposed project is out of scale to the area and not energy efficient. Moreover, each of the alternatives would potentially encroach on sensitive ecosystems, including Catskill Park/New York State forever wild lands.  We are all for renewable and sustainable energy.  But this project does not fit well here.

Our region is packed full of headwater streams and waterfalls that would lend themselves well to small hydro projects.  Why in the world would you want to pump water upstream to create a massive closed loop system?  This would be highly inefficient and totally unnecessary.  There are so many opportunities to work with the natural hydraulic corridors here. So why would anyone want to work against them?  Makes little sense – is it just to have a massive project that is not wanted by the locals here?  Exploring smaller scale projects would be so much smarter, and not infringe nearly as much on the beautiful ecosystem we have here.  Larger pumped power storage systems can be useful, but not here.

The future will be in energy efficiency, but this is not efficient.  Not only is there an obviously huge waste of energy in this proposed concept, but energy is also wasted as soon as it enters the grid.  It has been suggested that the pumping energy might be supplied by solar panels during the day. Where would you put those?  Raze our forever wild forest lands?  Or maybe you could construct them miles away and transmit the energy through transmission lines, wasting even more energy.

There are much better solutions to solving our energy challenges, so please don’t go down this short-sighted road.  We need to think further out into the future.  And while a massive concrete uphill holding reservoir is not a good long-term answer, it does have the potential to create long term and possibly permanent damage here.

Thank you for reading my comments.
