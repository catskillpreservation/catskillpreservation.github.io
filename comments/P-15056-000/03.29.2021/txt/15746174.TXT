The proposed Ashokan pump storage project will cause severe environmental damage directly and indirectly to the area. It will contaminate wells and the surrounding underground water table, due to the chemicals and processes in excavation. It will also damage and affect plant and animal  species that live in a protected area. It would also affect the quality of the drinking water the is supply to NY city.  We request that you do not grant the preliminary permit to this project.
