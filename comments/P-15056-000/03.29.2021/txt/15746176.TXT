As someone who recreates on, and lives very near to, the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. It will also have multiple adverse effects, beyond the actual construction areas that we cannot foresee. What kind of wide disturbances will be produced? The vibrations and noise this equipment could produce would also travel long distances underground even further disrupting the environment. So much is at stake. We can't replace one kind of bad system with another one that could destroy the drinking water of 9 million people and cause irreparable harm to the ecosystems it connects with. Spare us this nightmare. It would ruin the entire area, and cause untold economic as well as environmental loss.

I urge you do do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
