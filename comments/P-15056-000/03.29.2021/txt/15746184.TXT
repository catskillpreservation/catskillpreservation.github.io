Bradley Johnsmeyer, Rosendale, NY.
This proposal seems to have major issues that would not only impact the water quality, but the health of the Catskill ecosystem at large around the Ashokan reservoir. 

The well-being of the people in the area, the ability for New Yorkers to be able to enjoy our forests and watershed, without an ill-conceived idea that could destroy our trout fishery, the drinking water, and the on-going tourism in our county, should be paramount. 

Please reject this proposal.
