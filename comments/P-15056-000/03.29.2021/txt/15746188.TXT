I’m an Olive resident who is worried about the pumped storage hydro proposed. I’m worried about impacts on the beautiful wilderness of the Catskills, the related tourist economy which benefits my direct neighbors, and the impacts on the NYC water supply, where I also live. The Catskills forest preserve, designated as status 1 or 2 should be preserved.  Thank you.
