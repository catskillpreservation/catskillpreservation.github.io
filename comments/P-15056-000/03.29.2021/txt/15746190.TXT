Concerning docket P-15056:000
  I’m writing in opposition to the proposal for a pumped storage hydro project in the Catskills Forest Preserve. As a resident of West Shokan and also as a consumer of New York City drinking water, I believe this is not an appropriate choice of site. Having seen parts of the proposal, it strikes me that your company has not considered many of the essential aspects of this region that make it a terrible location. 
  Under the NYS constitution, Article XIV, the Catskills forests “shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”. Indeed, this area is pristine Status 1 preserve. It shall be forever kept as wild forest lands”.
  Aside from the huge disruption to and destruction of ecosystems, small roadways and homes and impact on local tourism, the potential for silty runoff into the NYC water system is cause enough for this project to be moved elsewhere. Please let us keep the Catskills as pristine forest lands. 
   Thank you.
