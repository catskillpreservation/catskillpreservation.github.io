To whom it may concern, 

As a long time residents of West Shokan in Olive New York, We strongly object to the proposed hydroelectric plant, penstock and pumped storage reservoir proposed for our area. We feel that the proposed project would be destructive to our community and fundamentally change our way of life. It's construction would be disruptive and the associated infrastructure would scar the land in an otherwise pristine landscape that is enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. 

Please consider using another location for the proposed project!
