My family and I moved up here from New Jersey approximately 9 years ago as we saw firsthand the destruction of land and waterways that was so obvious from Energy Companies such as Southern California called Premium Energies.  My family and I object to this underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir or for that matter any land or waterway in the Catskill Region.  The Great People of the Catskills do not need this not do want any Energy Company being intrusive onto our land and communities that we here in the Catskills hold so dear.
Again, The Chazik Family stands firm as being vehemently opposed to this or for that matter any hydroelectric plant in our communities.
