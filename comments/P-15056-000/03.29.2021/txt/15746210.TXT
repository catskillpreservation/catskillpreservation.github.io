I was disturbed to learn of the recently proposed hydroelectric overhaul of the region by Premium Energy Holdings. Residents of the Catskills are keenly aware of our area's past exploitation, and to have a company propose continuing that tradition is the antithesis of what we stand for.

I am also fully aware of how easy it would be for these concerns to be dismissed as knee-jerk, or based on an incomplete understanding of the project. So instead I'll approach it with the objective question: would such a project produce more good or more harm? 


From what information is available, the good seems pretty minimal: 

-Premium Energy Holdings employs and shareholders will see a benefit.
-Such projects can contribute to reducing our overall dependence on fossil fuels. (However any climate-change gains may be undercut by the energy and resources required for production and operation.)


Meanwhile the harm caused by such a project seems far greater:

-Permanent alteration and destruction of the regions water systems.  I've seen first-hand how even year-to-year changes in rainfall have had drastic impacts on our local streams, ponds, rivers, and overall watershed: recurring summer dry spells have meant even existing reservoirs have been dangerously low, as has the water table we rely on for our home wells. This is the time for us to be working to preserve our water sources, not altering them further. As others have brought up, this issue affect not just the Catskills region but New York City itself, which relies on our existing reservoirs for its water supply.

-Displacement of and negative impact on the region's peoples. This project will inevitably lead to people's homes being destroyed. This is something we have been through before with the construction of the existing Ashokan reservoir, a time we do not look back on fondly. In addition such a project will affect every resident's ability to travel, as well as potentially damage the tourism industry that sustain towns from Woodstock to Phonecia to Hunter. 

-Massive losses to and displacement of wildlife. The Catskills are a unique oasis for flora and fauna that are otherwise struggling from climate change and human development. As mentioned before, it wasn't too long ago that most this area was clear-cut. Thanks to state protections our natural areas are finally beginning to return to their former glory- to the benefit of us all. To flood these areas and cut down acres of forest for powerlines and pipelines would be to undo all that progress.  

So it is for all these reasons that I believe a project of this nature would objectively be a detriment to the region, and I hope that Premium Energy Holdings will take this into consideration going forward.
