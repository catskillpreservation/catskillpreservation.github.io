To Whom It May Concern,

I am contacting you in regards to the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal (P-15056). This proposal was developed by the private electric company Premium Energy, based in California, and involves the construction of a for-profit hydroelectric dam in Olive, Woodland, or Lanesville. The proposed dam would reach up to 300 feet and connect to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel drilled under public and private land. This dam would be problematic for numerous reasons.

The dam would need to flood at least 200 acres to construct a new reservoir, which would negatively impact the ecology of the Catskills Forest Preserve, which is protected by the NY State Constitution. This would reduce the amount of recreational area available for hikers, and it would also endangered several threatened species.  Moreover, the dam would reduce the quality of New York Cityâ€™s drinking water, as well as negatively affect the streams that locals and tourists use for fishing, boating, and swimming. Due to the damage the dam will inflict on the local area, tourism would decrease, and many of the nearby towns rely on tourist dollars for their revenue, which would hurt their communities.

My family owns a summer cabin that has stood for several generations. If the dam is built, it would directly impact the property.

Please help me and others stop the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Aaron Greenbaum
