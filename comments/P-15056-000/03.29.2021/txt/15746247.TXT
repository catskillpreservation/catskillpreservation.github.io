Basis for Intervening:
To Whom it may Concern:

This is to request Intervener status on the hydro-electric power station and dam project proposed by Premium Energy, a California Company that seeks to build a reservoir less than a mile from our home in a protected area of the Catskill Mountains that will devastate the residential area, destroy the habitat of wildlife and endangered species, transform the local community with power lines, water tunnels and a power station, and which will threaten the Ashokan reservoir that supplies drinking water to 9 million residents in New York City.
