This is a comment regarding the proposed Ashokan Pump Station. The proposal from Premier Energy is neglectful of the sensitive nature of the proposed site. Most specifically our reservoir water which will be turbid,  will wreck havoc on our environment- fauna and flora, high power transmission lines will be near homes and can be detrimental to health especially the young and elderly, and will effect tourism. 
Furthermore, Catskill Forest Preserve. 1885 states lands in this status 1 area are to be avoided for development.
Therefore, this project should not be under consideration.
