re: FERC project sub docket # P-15056:000 "Ashokan Pumped Storage Project"

To whom it may concern: 

I would like to express my concern in regard to the above proposed project since all three possible locations would impact highly preserved land and stream ecology of the Catskill Forest Preserve.

Under the USGS "Gap Analysis Program" the Catskill Forest Preserve is considered Status 1 land. According to DOE's own Hydropower Vision "areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS program are to be avoided for development".

Furthermore, the Catskill Forest Preserve is protected by the NYS constitution. Any changes to land management would require a constitutional amendment, to be voted on and passed by two consecutive sessions and then submitted to the public in a referendum.

Thirdly, Premium Energy is proposing this project to FERC as a "closed loop project", a type of project the DOE supports. The above project is not a closed, but an open loop project since it involves the Ashokan Reservoir as the lower basin. which has the Esopus River running into it and out of it.

Sincerely,
