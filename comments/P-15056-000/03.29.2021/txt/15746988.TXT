I live in Chichester, NY, near one of the proposed sites Premium Energy Holdings is considering for an upper reservoir that would connect to the Ashokan. After reading the proposal, and based on my knowledge of the area, I urge you to deny PEH a preliminary permit to conduct studies on a proposed pumped storage plant. The Catskill Forest Preserve is not the right place for this project, and this for-profit company’s proposal threatens to do more environmental and economic damage than it sets out to solve.
 
All three of the sites under consideration in Premium Energy’s proposal are within the Catskill State Park, which is protected from development by the NYS Constitution unless amended otherwise. These three sites also fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Areas. Further, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the United States Geological Survey’s “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
 
Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which threaten both aquatic and land habitats. Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills most vital trout waters and part of New York City's water supply. Disrupting the local ecology and subjecting our local waters to cooling and evaporation are not the kinds of trade-offs we can afford. Nor is the potential to seriously harm New York City’s water supply.
 
Please deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit so that local experts can work toward genuine solutions to our energy needs.
 
Sincerely,
 
Traci Parks
