RE: The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

We all know time goes on and takes technology with it. But one has to weigh the positive and negative impact of technology on those who it interacts with.

Do we want to flood areas of our community where folks lived and have lived for decades? No!
Do we want to relocate families? No!
Do we want high voltage power lines running right past our house? No!

What are the positives of this plan? That Central Hudson can generate more electricity during the off peak hours to use during peak time? That the company involved putting this all together can make a lot of money doing it?

What are the negatives? Many, many families will be impacted. Their entire lives will have to change. Their serene existence in the Hudson Valley, in the Catskill Mountains will be disrupted. Many will be exposed to the - not disproven - health effects of power lines. Property values will go down for all near those lines. 

We donâ€™t want it.
