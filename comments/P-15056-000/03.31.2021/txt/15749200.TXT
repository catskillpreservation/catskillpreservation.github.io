Ms. Bose,

I’m writing regarding Premium Energy Holdings of California’s proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains, including a 300-acre reservoir at one of three sites and a tunnel to bring the water to the east shore of the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir. The three sites are Chichester, Woodland Valley, and the Moonhaw valley in the hamlet of West Shokan, Town of Olive. My comments focus on Moonhaw and West Shokan.  

This construction would impact state land, and as a designated Wilderness Area of the New York State Forest Preserve, the upper reaches of Moonhaw valley are protected from development, per Article XIV of the New York State Constitution.

Also building in these areas would have a devastating impact on tourism in the Catskills, which is integral to the NYS economy, generating 17% of employment in the region in 2019 and providing about 20K jobs, with Ulster County representing 43% of that market and second homes in the area creating $360 million in economic activity.  

Moonhaw is also a community with many homes, valued up to $2.5 million each. This thriving community would be decimated by this construction.

I strongly urge you to recommend that Premium Energy’s proposal be rejected.

Sincerely,

Jenn Wexler
