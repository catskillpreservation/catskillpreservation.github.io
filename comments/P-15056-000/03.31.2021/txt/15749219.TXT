Douglas Kerr, Schenectady, NY.
As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for millions of people in both Upstate New York and New York City. If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets in the process. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
