The company seeking the permit have shown zero concern for the people, community and land that the project would impact.  Their assurances that the project would only be undertaken with approval of the community are entirely hollow, evidenced by the complete lack of due diligence done before dropping proposed reservoir sites onto a map.  The applicant clearly did not make even the most basic effort to understand the areas they propose to investigate.  Had they done so, they would have easily realized that their proposal would encroach on legally protected forever wild lands and displace entire hamlets and residential areas.

Rather than requiring the community to go on high alert and rush to defend itself against a poorly though out proposal, perhaps the better path would be for the applicant to construct a proposal that is not completely devoid of basic knowledge, insight on or concern for the local region.  Then having demonstrated that basic level of due diligence, the community could with sufficient time and information, thoughtfully consider and respond taking all the pros and cons into account.

Until then, I ask the FERC to say NO and our elected officials and community to vigorously defend against this proposal.
