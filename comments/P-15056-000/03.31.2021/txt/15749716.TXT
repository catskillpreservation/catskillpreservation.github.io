As a non-profit business in one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, we vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

We are a tourist attraction, and this unsightly project would negatively impact tourism in our town. Also, years ago we did a large study on the local ecology in our valley, and our property and surrounding area are home to several endangered species of birds (including the eastern hellbender and the Bicknell's Thrush), a rare sanctuary to hundreds of species of lichen, in addition to providing habitats for rabbits, foxes, deer, turkeys, coyotes, fisher cats, bears, and even mountain lions, among other species.

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, disrupt the local ecosystem, and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
