Basis for Intervening:
Theodore Gordon Flyfisher, Inc, (TGF) is a not-for-profit angling organization committed to stream and river protection and the preservation of wild trout populations in the Catskills.  If approved, the proposed project will impact the quality of the water of the Esopus and its tributaries.  TGF moves to be made an Intervenor in these proceedings to represent its members, who have a vital interest in the protection of these rivers and streams.  TGF’s members are avid anglers that live in the Northeast and frequently fish in the Esopus and its tributaries.

Since its founding in 1963, TGF’s singular mission has been to preserve the habitat of wild trout populations, including the native brook trout in New York State.  The locations of any of the three dams proposed for the project will eliminate or severely restrict the flow of water in a tributary to the Esopus river.  Each of those tributaries provide critical spawning habitat for wild and nativized trout, including native brook trout.  Reducing spawning habitat will impact the population of wild trout in the river system and degrade the quality of the river system that TGF members use for recreation.  

TGF members are intimately familiar with the condition of these streams.  Many of them have spent a lifetime fishing these waters. On behalf of its members, TGF successfully sued the City of New York under the Clean Water Act to require the City to monitor and reduce turbidity of water the city released into the Esopus.  See Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. City of New York, 451 F.3d 77, 62 ERC 1737 (2d Cir. 2006).  Through its continued efforts to advocate for the protection of the Esopus, TGF’s directors and members have gained a deep understanding of the river system and can provide a unique perspective to the proceedings.   

TGF works hard to keep its members informed of conservation issues that effect the cold-water fisheries around the Northeast, including the Esopus watershed.  For over twenty years TGF has kept its members informed about important conservation issues in the region through the publication of its newsletter, Gordon’s Quill https://www.tgf.org/publications.  The TGF board receives feedback from its members and remains informed of their concerns.  Granting this petition to have TGF added as a party to these proceedings will allow TGF to represent the interest of its members related to this project. 

Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion.
