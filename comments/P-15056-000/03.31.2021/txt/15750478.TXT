Dear Secretary Bose,
Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Rules, Practices and Procedures (18 CFR Section 385.314) the Woodland Community Association, the only organization representing home and property owners in the hamlet of Woodland Valley in the Town of Shandaken, Ulster County New York, hereby petitions the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant it intervener status in the above proceeding. 

All communications should be addressed to:

Bethany Saltman
President

Basis for Intervening: 
The Woodland Community Association represents the home and property owners of Woodland Valley who have an interest in the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the Commission by Premium Energy for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056). The proposed reservoir in Woodland Valley would either flood, or cut off access to, almost all of 200+ homes in Woodland Valley. Accordingly, the Woodland Valley residents have a primary and vital interest in this matter. We seek to become a party to this proceeding to insure that the interests of the residents are properly represented. 

Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion. In light of the foregoing, the Woodland Community Association respectfully petitions for intervener status. 


Bethany Saltman
President 
Woodland Community Association
