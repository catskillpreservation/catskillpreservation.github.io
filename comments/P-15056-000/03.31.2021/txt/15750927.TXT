Morgan Lyle, Brooklyn, NY.
I write to ask the Commission to reject P-15056, the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to construct a pumped storage facility in the Esopus Creek watershed in New York.

As a resident of New York City, I find the potential for damage to the cityâ€™s drinking water supply completely unacceptable. As a native of Ulster County, I am appalled by the idea of burying any of the three communities and locales cited in the proposal, each of which I have visited whenever possible throughout my lifetime. And as an avid angler, I can scarcely believe that anyone in the 21st century would suggest destroying the habitats of heritage-strain brook trout and wild, self-sustaining rainbow trout. The project would be very damaging to the outdoor recreation industry that is so important to the area.

I am a strong supporter of renewable energy, but this proposal is a terrible idea. Again, I ask you to reject it.
