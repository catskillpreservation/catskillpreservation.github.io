Hello,

I am very concerned about this proposed hydro-electric power plant from Premium Energy LLC and I vehemently oppose it. By allowing this to be built you will destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The project would increase turbidity and pollution in the protected Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s drinking water. Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that has ALREADY displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.
 The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution and this proposal is in violation of it. We will take this to the rest of the NYS government  to voice our concern as this proposed plant is illegal and should not move forward.
