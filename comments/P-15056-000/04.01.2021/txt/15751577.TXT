I am writing today, as a concerned Catskills property owner, about a CA company, Premium Energy Holdings recent proposal to FREC, regarding creating a pumped storage hydroelectric plant, using the Ashokan Reservoir.

Despite the fact that I strongly support clean/ renewable energy initiatives, I oppose this move for 2 primary reasons:

(1)  This project will significantly impact homes and communities, local infrastructure, water quality, and natural habitats on public and private lands.  Recreational use of the land, tourism and local economies would also be impacted. 

(2) This plan was submitted without input from NYCDEP, NYSâ€™s Dept of Environmental Conservation, or from local leaders or stakeholders.  

I firmly believe that this project should not move forward. 

Sincerely,

Tricia Bard
