I live in Woodland Clove. I treasure the wildlife here and love trout fishing in the Esopus. Premium Energy's Proposal would disrupt the ecology in this area. I would harm the economy from tourism, as people come from many places to fish and enjoy the Catskills. The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. I urge you to stop this project immediately.
Thank you.
