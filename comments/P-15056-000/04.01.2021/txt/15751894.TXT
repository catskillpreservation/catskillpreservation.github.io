To Whom it may Concern,
​FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA goes directly against New York State Constitution. “ The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed.” – Article XIV, New York State Constitution.  
Reasons to say “NO” to the proposed dam.
- The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index
- As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
- Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the NYC water supply
- The largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, built at the cost of displacing 25 communities
The American people have been stepped on too many times, please do not hurt our mountains any further.
Sincerely,
Camran Hartman
