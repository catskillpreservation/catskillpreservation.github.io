This is a very bad idea. Please ensure that New York City is involved in responding to this terrible proposal. In addition to the severe environmental impact to a beautiful wild state-protected area, the ultimate consequences to the water system of the greater New York City area would be profound. It was also very sneaky of the company to make this proposal without informing highly interested parties such as New York City Department of Environmental Protection, not to mention state and local government entities. It is an indication that this company has a severe lack of principles and trustworthiness. Please deny the proposal.
