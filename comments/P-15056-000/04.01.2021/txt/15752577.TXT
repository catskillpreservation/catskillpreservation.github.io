To whom is may concern:

I am writing to voice my extreme concern about Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP's application for preliminary permit for document (docket number P-15056-000). I believe this proposed project would be very detrimental for the environment, the community, and Ulster County's economy. 

Specific concerns include:

1: The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and this would disrupt this protected land
2: The project would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYCâ€™s drinking water
3: The project would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents
4: The destruction of our natural beauty would negatively impact tourism, an important source of positive economic impact for Ulster County

Please do not allow this proposal to move forward.

With kind regards,

Eric J. Della Vedova
