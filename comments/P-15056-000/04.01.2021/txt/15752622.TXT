This project will be a disaster on many levels

The Catskills Forest Preserve are meant to be forever kept as wild
forest lands.

The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

There will be terrible impacts on local stream ecology and impacts to the NYC water supply

There will be large impacts on our local tourism economy.
