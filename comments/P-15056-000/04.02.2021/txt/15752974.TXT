I am vehemently opposed to the project Premium Energy wishes to undertake in the towns of Shandaken and Olive. 

While I understand that energy storage is a critical issue for our region, the Catskills are not the proper location for such a project, and I question the appropriateness of this particular technology. According to my research, the Department of Energy stated in 2013, in a study covering pumped storage technology, that “no energy future was found to bring quantifiable revenues sufficient to cover estimated costs of plant construction.”

My understanding of the technology is that the upper reservoir would be subject to frequent water level changes, a disaster for the rainbow trout fishery that preserves wildlife and forms an important part of the local tourist economy.

This environmentally sensitive area would be adversely impacted by the flooding of valleys. Please do not allow this project to go forward.

Thanks for listening.
