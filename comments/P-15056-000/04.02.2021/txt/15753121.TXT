I am a resident of West Shokan, a hamlet in the town of Olive, New York. 

West Shokan, as well as the very road I live on, Moonhaw Road, is one of the towns being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a 300-foot dam, giant reservoir, turbine, and 50-foot tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. There will also be unsightly transmission towers up and down many roads, the mountain and valleys, and along the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies drinking water 40% of water to New York City. A power plant would be built right next to the Ashokan reservoir. 
 
I reject this proposal, object to this proposal and downright am horrified by this proposal, which would negatively impact the environment, destroy communities, upend the homes of many wild creatures great and small. The construction would permanently damage the rivers and streams, and the power plant would disrupt the flow to and increase the turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir, destroy mountains, as well as the quiet beauty of the Catskills, where people have been coming for centuries for respite. I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. Whoever is reading this, please do everything you and your FERC colleagues can do to stop this proposal from going one step further. Thank you, Mary Huhn
