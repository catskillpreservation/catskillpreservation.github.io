Re:  Premiere Energy's proposition inside the Catskill Park, NY


Dear Secretary Bose:

    I am absolutely shocked that there is even a proposal for an energy project to be constructed inside the Catskill Park in Ulster County NY.  The land proposed for this project is within the “forever wild” forest lands created by New York State in 1885.  According to the NYS constitution  this land can not “be leased, sold, or exchanged, or taken by any corporation public or private.”  Any change to this must be made through constitutional amendment.  This proposal should not even be considered.

Also this project will impact the NYC watershed.  The city receives 40% of its water from the watershed with one of its most important reservoir just miles from the proposed project.  When you live in the watershed putting in a septic system is highly regulated by NYC DEP.  How can something this big and disruptive be considered under these circumstances?

This area of western Ulster County is highly dependent on tourism.  People come here for the pristine beauty of the Catskills as well as to fish in the premiere trout fishing stream, the Esopus.  If this project were to move forward the rapid water fluctuations that would occur would destroy the habitat and breeding grounds of trout.  This project would be a blight on that pristine beauty.

While the town of Olive, where this proposed project would be primarily located, is currently trying to come up with more environmentally friendly ways of supplying energy for our town this proposal is not.  The claim that this is a closed loop project is false.  The plan to have “add on” projects means it is not a closed loop therefore far more detrimental to our environment, in our town, our home.  I can  not believe that this is a project that the Department of Energy would approve as being in line with caring for the environment.

We moved here 40 years ago to live in the mountains and in the Catskill Park.  We do not want to see the beauty of our town, our home destroyed by a company trying to sneak its way into our county.   I hope that you will consider that our current administration ran on caring for the environment and that you will see that this project would jeopardize the forever wild environment of the Catskill Park in Ulster County, town of Olive NY.
 
Sincerely,
