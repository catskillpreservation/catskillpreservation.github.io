I am writing to protest the proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant that would do irreparable damage to the Catskill Forest Preserve and surrounding areas. I am extremely concerned about the impact that this proposal would have on these highly preserved forests, the wildlife and ecosystems therein. Green energy is important and infrastructure always involves trade-offs between individual and public interests, but this proposal does not seem to offer the kind of innovation that would best serve the public in the long term. FERC should deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit, and consider other locations. This proposal is likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and cause
increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for
nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to stop this from moving forward. Thank you.
