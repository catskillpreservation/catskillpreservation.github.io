To Whom It May Concern,
I’m vehemently opposed to project P-15056-000 for the following reasons,
1. The desecration of the natural habitat and wildlife in the path of the proposed reservoir and power lines.
2. The possibility of water wells that can be effected.
3. The effects that this project on the Ashokan Reservoir will have on New York City’s main clean water supply.
4. Damage and changes of town roads that will effect travel due to heavy construction vehicles while construction could last anywhere from 7 to 10 years.
5. This project will stifle tourism and local businesses while removing properties from the current tax base.
6. My wife and I built our home 52 years ago and we raised our children here while tending to the acreage raising farm animals and growing vegetables and being what we considered good stewards of the land. Now in our so called “Golden years” we find ourselves in the position that our home will be uninhabitable due to the proposed 2 power lines/ towers going directly over the rooftop of our house. At the age of 78 we will be uprooted and forced to start a new life God knows where. I would not wish this on anyone! 
Please consider these and many other negative aspects that this project will have on our protected lands.
 
Respectfully 
Richard Lipfert, 52 Brodhead Rd, West Shokan, NY 12494
