I am strongly opposed to the Proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant in the Catskill Mountains.
My family and I have escaped to the Catskills from NYC and NJ for the past 80 years. The area has been mostly untouched by any major development for most of that time period.
It is still a beautiful area where nature still thrives now as it has for centuries.  This plant would bring environmental devastation.

I currently own a home on the Esopus Creek in Phoenicia.
I understand renewable energy is important but the plan is not good for the Catskills, an area that must be left alone for the reasons I will share below:

According to Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands "shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private".  This proposal violates Article XIV.

The impact on stream ecology from the pumped water would wreak havoc on valuable trout breeding in addition to properties like mine that are on the Esopus Creek.

This project would also pose risks to the NYC water supply which cost billions of dollars of investment; $1.7 billion since the 1990s alone.

This project would also have a major impact on the Catskills tourism economy. Tourism is integral to the NYS economy.  Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskills in 2019. It is a $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Ulster County represents 43% of that market.  And second homes generate $360 million in economic activity of which none want their land taken away due to "eminent domain". 

Thank you for letting me voice my opinion.

If you would like to contact me directly, please feel free.

Respectfully,
