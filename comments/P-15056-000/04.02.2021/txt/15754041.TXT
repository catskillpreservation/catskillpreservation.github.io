Please be advised that this application should be rejected on the merits of the fact it is mislabeled as an application for a closed loop hydroelectric system which it is not. It is an “add-on” hydroelectric system. 
This system is also being proposed to be located in a highly environmentally sensitive area that is designated wild and restricted   Class one environmental sensitive area not to be developed for any purpose.
