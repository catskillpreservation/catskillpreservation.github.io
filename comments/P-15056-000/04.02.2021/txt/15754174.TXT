Dear Secretary Bose,

Please do everything in your power to STOP Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

It is illogical, not to mention incredibly stupid, to use more energy to pump water up to a storage area than one would get when it is released downhill. 

It is immoral to destroy the homes and lives of countless people, fauna and flora in order to create this storage area. It is immoral to violate the Catskill Forest preserve. It is incredibly stupid to build a three-hundred-foot dam in an era when dams are known to cause more harm than good. It is incredibly stupid not to anticipate a catastrophe from a burst dam, which would wreak havoc for years.

This proposal is NOT great brains at work. This proposal is an ecological nightmare. STOP THIS PROPOSAL.
