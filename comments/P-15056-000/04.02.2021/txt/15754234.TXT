The Catskill Forest Preserve has been protected by the NY State Constitution since 1885. Designated Status One Land, the Dept. of Energy respects this land as requiring strict protection against development. I was born and raised in the area, and it is a truly special and unique part of the country that holds great value in so many ways.

The Ashokan Pump Storage Project would be in violation of the NY State Constitution, increasing turbidity in NYC drinking water (approximately 1 billion gallons for 9.5 million persons daily), scarring the Ashokan Watershed area, disrupting our tourism economy, and displacing area residents for a second time.

Article XIV of the NYS Constitution specifically states that these forested lands "shall be forever kept as wild...". And that they "shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private." 

As a pristine 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat, the forested area ranks among the top 1% of such habitats region-wide. The Catskill's own State Forest Preserve is considered Status One Land under the USGS "Gap Analysis Program".  Areas considered Status One, with formal protections under the Dept. of Energy "Hydropower Vision" are specified as to be avoided for development. 

This proposed Ashokan Pump Storage Project is an unacceptable project for the intended area.  As this proposal has been earmarked by Premium of California to be a "Closed-Loop" system - which given the existence of the connected Esopus River it most certainly would not be, but rather an "Add-on" - their proposal should not even be considered.

Thank you for your time,

Brendon Shapiro
