To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to voice my objection to Project P-15056-000.

I have been a resident of the town of Olive for 52 years and I am very concerned about the negative effects that this project will have on such a pristine area which is currently protected by the New York State constitution.

These are my concerns:

1. The negative effects on the New York City water supply and local wells.
2. The destruction of wildlife habitat and forestry.
3. The decline of tourism in this area that would directly affect our local community and businesses.
4. Many residents will be displaced including my family due to the proposed power lines that will directly run over my property and home.

In closing, I want to emphasize my commitment to preserve the natural environment of the Catskills Park and respectfully ask you to deny any permit applications related to this project.

Respectfully,
 
Regina Lipfert
