I grew up in West Shokan, where my maternal ancestors lived since 1792. I currently have a house in Olivebridge. The Ashokan Reservoir is beautiful; it is also the evocative watery grave of Old West Shokan and nine other hamlets in the Towns of Olive and Hurley. Recently nearby “new” Boiceville was carelessly  partially erased due to flood mitigation. The latest lunacy, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, is not needed and is a threat to the public. It would be unsightly. This project is far too much of a risk to a precious resource: drinking water. It was conceived of by secretive opportunistic entrepreneurs from distant states with no appreciation of nor respect for the culture, historic, and ecological significance of the area. West Shokan and the Ashokan are sensitive environmentally. The Catskills have been abused enough; please do not allow it to happen again.
