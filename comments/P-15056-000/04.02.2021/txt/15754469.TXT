It’s an admirable idea to improve sustainable energy   storage and reduce cost. The proposal in question raises several issues — cost,immediate Impact on local communities and long-term amenity.

No cost estimate is included in the proposal, but on the face of it, the amount and nature  of construction must be considerable.

Extensive construction in a remote area — much of it designated wilderness — will cause considerable upheaval to local residents, and reduce attraction to tourists.  The Catskill Park is unique in its unspoiled nature and its accessibility to East Coast population centers.

The final form of the project is unclear, but at the very least there will be new building and transmission lines. The impact on the unique character of the Catskill Park will be permanent. 

Finally, with the best will in the world, there will be some impact on the Ashokan Reservoir, the major supply of water to New York City.   

For these reasons I oppose the proposal
