As a local resident who supports clean energy development as an essential part of our transition away from fossil fuels, I believe we should not immediately decide against a project such as the Ashokan pumped hydropower proposal without at least understanding both the costs and the benefits.  Premium Energy should be allowed to do its feasibility study, so that we can make a decision based on facts and evidence, and actually weigh the costs against the benefits.
