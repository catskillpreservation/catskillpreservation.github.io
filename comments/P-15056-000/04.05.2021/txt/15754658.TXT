To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in protest of the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for which  you have received a Preliminary Permit Application.  It is inconceivable that such a project has even been suggested for our quiet, pristine country location.  The effect of such an undertaking would completely change the character of our local communities and environs.

In the Town of Olive there is currently a civil ongoing discussion about just how the town should control development.  There is no doubt in my mind that if this project is approved the citizenry of Olive will be completely united in doing all that it can to prevent the first shovelful of rural earth to be disturbed. Many citizens of the Town of Olive are still smarting from the Ashokan Dam project which flooded and destroyed Olive City and Olivebridge.  That project was completed 115 years ago, yet remains a serious bone of contention in Olive. The proposed project brings the Ashokan Dam project to the minds of the citizens of Olive, New York.  Please deny the Preliminary Permit, help us preserve our communities and environment and make unneeded what is certain to be a powerful and universal objection to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. 

Thank you,
