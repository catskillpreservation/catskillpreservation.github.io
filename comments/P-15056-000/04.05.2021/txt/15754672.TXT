This project would create a concrete water storage facility at one of three places:

In Lanesville, NY  by damming Stony Clove Creek along Route 214 creating a water storage facility  of 245 acres

In Phonecia, NY by damming Woodland Valley Creek from Pantherkill Road up to Fawn Hill Lane, creating a water storage facility  of about 313 acres

In West Shokan, NY by damming Maltby Hollow Brook along Moon Haw Road, creating a water storage facility of about 226 acres

As a long-time homeowner in the region and a strong proponent of renewable energy, I am writing to express my opposition to this project. This project is massive and, if constructed, will severely damage whatever local stream is picked for the dam. As a trout fisherman, I recognize that it would significantly damage the ecology of an area that has been long been preserved by the constitution of the State of New York and local and state laws. Much of this area is pristine wilderness and its smaller streams are spawning habitat for  the native trout which are a very vital part of the natural food chain. In addition, I’m concerned (as I work frequently in New York City and use its water supply) about a negative impact on its water supply because of the connection of the project to the Ashokan Reservoir.

This is NOT a closed loop project. It’s an add-on to an existing reservoir.  This project  is not the kind of “innovation” DOE needs. If approved, it will take years to construct, and will be a net consumer of energy once in operation. It’s inherent inefficiency creates the specter of a stranded asset in the future.  The DOE ought to be investing its resources into large-scale battery storage, not this 19th Century technology.

It is vital that FERC prevent this project from moving forward.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
