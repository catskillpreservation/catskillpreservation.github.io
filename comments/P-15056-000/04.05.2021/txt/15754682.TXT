I am vehemently opposed to this application made by Premium Energy Holdings.  The application and the project about which it relates contain many flaws, among the gravest being:

(A) The project's location in a state preserve protected by the state's constitution;
(B) The project would cause increased turbidity in the Ashokan watershed and negatively impact New York City's drinking water;
(C) The project would be detrimental to the local communities surrounding the project causing disruption to the local economy and displacing residents.

Respectfully submitted,
Jack Pliskin
