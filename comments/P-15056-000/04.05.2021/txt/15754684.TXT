The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, to be  "forever kept wild" and not "leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any
corporation, public or private." Moreover, the Preserve is in an increasingly
fragmented environment. This project would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed, leading to a loss of trout breeding habitat and negatively impacting New York City's drinking water. It would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting the tourist economy and displacing residents. I urge rejection of the proposal.
