This is not at all a closed loop project, and not at all what the DOE is explaining as the type of project or proposal they're interested in supporting. Not to mention, you're literally choosing sites for an add-on project in a U.S. Forest Preserve. The effort to fight this proposal even 5 years out is heated here locally, to put it mildly.
