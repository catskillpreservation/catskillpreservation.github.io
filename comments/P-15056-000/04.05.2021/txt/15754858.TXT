I am opposed to the Ashokan Reservoir hydroelectric proposal. I, and many local residents and sportsmen argue that the proposal would negatively impact the quality of the NYC drinking water, the pristine habitat of our trout hatchery, and  natural environment. The proposal clearly does not add to the quality of life for our NYS tax-paying citizens. All around, it is an unnecessary and bad idea.
