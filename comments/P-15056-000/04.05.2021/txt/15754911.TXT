Dear Sirs and Mesdames:

	I write to submit my opposition to docket number P 150-56000, the proposal by Premium Energy of California, to construct a dam and two holding basins in the Catskill Mountains State Forest Preserve. if approved, This proposal, submitted by an out-of-state corporation that has no responsibility to the taxpayers and citizens of New York State, would impact land that is set aside by the NYS Constitution as forever wild, for the benefit of New Yorkers.
	As an historian and a naturalist writer, I have visited, written about, taught college students about, and enjoyed the Catskills for nearly 60 years. My family own two homes in the Catskills. To see an outside corp[oration come in and threaten to destroy our pristine mountain environment is unacceptable. The affected territory is Status 1 land; it should therefore fall under constitutional protection from such development.
	As the recent and ongoing public health crisis has demonstrated so clearly, we all need the wilderness even more than we had imagined. This proposal for a hydro facility would be counter to all of our heightened concerns for the environment. The project of Premium Energy must be rejected.
	Thank you for your consideration. You may write to me at: 
			
			9 Franklin Street
			Oneonta, New York 13820

		Sincerely,

		Dr. Peter A. Mark
