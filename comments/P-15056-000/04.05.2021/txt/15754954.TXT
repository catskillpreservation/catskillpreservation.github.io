I urge the commission to reject the preliminary permit application for project P-15056.  This project is ill conceived in many ways, three of which are as follows:

Legally:  the Catskill Forest Preserve is protected in perpetuity.  This project will not stand up in a court case, no matter the amount of legal fees it can afford.

Politically:  any possible turbulence of the Ashokan Reservoir or disturbance to the Catskill watershed threatens a major source of New York City’s water supply.  The protests would be massive.

Economically:  the only major industry in this region is its tourist industry.  The construction and continuing operation of this project would adversely effect the area’s natural beauty and quiet  upon which tourism is based.
