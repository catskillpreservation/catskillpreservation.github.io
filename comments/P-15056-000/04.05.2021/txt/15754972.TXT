I am a resident of the Town of Olive, Ulster County, New York where the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056) by Premium Energy LC is proposed to be located. The proposed upper Wittenberg Reservoir is located on NYS constitutionally protected Forever Wild lands. In addition, the project proposes damming the Maltby Hollow Brook Stream, a protected trout spawning stream.
 
I oppose this project on these grounds and object to the insensitivity to the people of the Town of Olive who have for generations have sacrificed their land and livelihoods to protect the drinking water of NYC in the Ashokan Reservoir. This is not a project the town can viably sustain as the scope and scale of this project will detrimentally change the landscape and quality of life of our town forever.
