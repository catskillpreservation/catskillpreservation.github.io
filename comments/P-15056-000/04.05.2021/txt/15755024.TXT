Hello-
Please reject this application for any permit due to the following important points-
The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution
It would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYCâ€™s drinking water
It would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents

We the local residents strongly object to this proposal.
Thank you
