This proposed project is certainly going to disastrously affect the aquifers as well as drinking water. Another result will be wells drying up.

The construction will not only destroy homes, it will wipe out a good part of the local environment as well. Those residents who won't be forced to move will have to endure all the noise and disturbances involved in constructing something of this magnitude, not to mention pollution caused by the machinery and construction debris.

Olive endured the destruction of several villages by the early 20th century construction of the New York City reservoir. It's taken Olive's inhabitants a full century to adjust to having this in our midst--and it still causes inconvenience to the residents of this township.

Dangerous high voltage wires are going to be above ground in an area where we already have more than the average amount of power outages due to above-ground wiring. This construction will only serve to increase outages.

It is definitely not going to be cost effective, which means the consumer will have to make up the difference. 

It will have an adverse effect on the townships of Olive, Shandaken and Woodstock, areas already badly affected by the influx of outsiders from NYC and other downstate areas. Much of the wild land has already been wiped out by the homes built by these newcomers. 

Suggestion: Go where there is no habitation for miles and miles and stay out of the Catskills. We've been through enough because of "outsiders."
