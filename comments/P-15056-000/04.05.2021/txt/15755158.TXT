To whom it may concern,

This comment is in opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

The disruption resulting from both construction and implementation of this project would be harmful to the natural, protected environment and disruptive to local communities. 

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land
under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own
Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2
under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any
corporation, public or private.”

To allow such a project to occur would not only harm wildlife, protected land, local residents, and tourism, it would set precedent for potential future projects of this kind. The serenity of the protected Forest Preserve was a primary reason we purchased our home in the Catskills in 2015, as so many others have done for decades.

My wife and I hope you will deny Premium Energy Holdings' request for the preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 and halt any potential for this project to occur.

Sincerely,
Scott Chasse
