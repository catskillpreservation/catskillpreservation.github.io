Re:  Project Docket:  P-15056

Hello, 

I am writing to comment on the Preliminary Permit application entitled the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  

I live only a few miles from the proposed Stony Clove reservoir, and I am also very familiar with the proposed Wittenberg and Woodland Valley sites.

I think the project would be terribly destructive in any of these proposed sites.  

The High Peaks area of the Catskills State Park is a well-loved recreation area for many, and a rare bit of wildness within reach for day trips from some of our most densely populated cities.  It would be a shame to diminish this with an industrial project.  Hikers and skiers in the Catskills would have views interrupted by transmission towers, anglers would have streams disturbed,  and all users and residents would have our narrow valleys disrupted for years  by construction traffic and noise.

I think this proposal should be denied.  I am afraid that if Premium Energy is granted permission to invest $5m in feasibility studies, that $5m will be like a ratchet, making it that much harder to deny a permit in the future.  This proposal clearly conflicts with existing recreational and environmental use of the area, and it should be denied now. 

Thank you,
Devon Russ
