I am a property owner and resident of Stone Ridge, NY in Ulster County and New York City. I am strongly opposed to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Power project for several reasons: this project (i) is an illegal project as it violates Article XIV of the New York State Constitution; (ii) will harm wildlife and preserved lands in upstate New York, which lands must be preserved for future generations; (iii) is highly likely to harm the drinking water in New York City and it is difficult to source clean drinking water for the millions of people residing ther; (iv) will harm other streams and waterways in the area with sediment, etc. (v) creates a net use of energy does not make any sense (using more than it generates);  (vi) requires building a new reservoir and dam which is damaging  as per the preceding and means that it is NOT "closed loop" and will therefore have a greater impact on the environment than Premium Energy is claiming; (vii) this area of the Catskills is close to New York City and has increasingly become a tourist area and an area sought after for its beauty and outdoor recreation, a large project like this will create blights on the land and will greatly dampen that enjoyment - note that Kingston New York, Marbletown, the Hunter/Windham area have had huge increases in property values in the last few years as more people seek affordable ways to seek recreation and/or live near metropolitan areas in pristine lands. If this project attempts to move forward it will be fought vigorously on the courts, as it should be.
Please DO NOT allow this project to move forward.
