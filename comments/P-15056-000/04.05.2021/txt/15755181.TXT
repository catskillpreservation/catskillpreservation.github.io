The Catskills have been protected by NYS constitution to keep it wild forever. This dam will not only affect the lives of those living in NYC's drinking water (and everyone in close proximity), but it will ruin land that was intended to be spared forever. This land is home to thousands, humans and wildlife alike roam these mountains for peace and a good life. This project would ruin so many ecological systems, will end up killing wildlife, and would be taking on of the most sacred spaces in NYS and making it just another for profit. I understand that the intentions are not to do harm, but that is exactly what this project would do. I beg you not to go through with it.
Sincerely,
Someone who knows the magic of the Catskills.
