I am writing to share some facts pertaining to why Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric dam in any of the three locations(Olive, Woodland, and Lanesville, NY) proposed in the Catskill Forest Preserve should not go forward.

First, all the locations proposed are located on protected land that is designated Status 1 by the United States Geological Society under the USGS Gap Analysis program, which provides “permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and mandated management plan to maintain a natural state.” (see https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/pad-us-data-overview?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

Second, even if the proposed land did not have Status 1, Premium seems to be trying to take shortcuts by misrepresenting the nature of the project. It is calling their project a closed loop system, with limited environmental impact, and high in desirability by entities such as DOE, while in actuality it is an add on system, adding on to the Esopus Creek or the Ashokan Reservoir. The artificial raising and lowering of water levels of the creek would have an adverse impact on the ecologically rich and fragile Esopus. The Ashokan Reservoir itself is fed by the Esopus. Both provide almost half of the drinking water to the 8.5 million residents of New York City.
