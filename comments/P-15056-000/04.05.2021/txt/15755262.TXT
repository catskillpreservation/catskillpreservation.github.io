I am a resident of West Shokan in the Town of Olive in Ulster County, NY.
A preliminary permit application (The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project) is now before FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This proposal includes building a large dammed reservoir in a New York State forest, an underground hydropower plant in West Shokan, and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the Town of Ulster. If allowed to proceed, this project will have materially  detrimental impact on our community.

I am opposed to The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for three reasons:

1. The Premium Energy proposal is not the kind of green energy project that the Department of Energy (DoE) wants:
• Premium Energy is proposing an open-looped pumped-storage hydropower project where the lower reservoir will be continuously connected to a naturally flowing upper reservoir. Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.
• Turbidity will prove a significant issue, as a 'lack' of this problem is the one reason the Ashokan reservoir does not require a filtration plant (as do NYC's other reservoirs).  This project threatens to force NYC to undergo the substantial investment of a new filtration plant, given the turbidity this project threatens to introduce.
• Premium Energy is claiming this to be “closed-loop.” It is not. Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects. That is what this project is.  Premium Energy is not being honest in its declarations.
• “Initial construction impacts” for open-loop projects are lower, but “operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the add-on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.” (Source: DoE: “A Comparison of the Env. Effects of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower.” April 2020)

2. There’s a substantial negative impact on highly preserved land:
• Premium Energy appears to be completely unaware that they are proposing a project in an extremely protected state preserve, a Status 1 area according to the USGS Gap Analysis.  Change in the State Forest Preserve is rare:
o Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.
o As of 1999, more than 2,000 amendments have been proposed. Only 29 made it to the referendum stage; of those, 20 passed. (Source: The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line)
• The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the DoE’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
• Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
• The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
• All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https://www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area.
• This area is protected for a reason.  It should not be disturbed.

3. There is a significant negative Impact on stream ecology
o Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats.
o Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the New York City water supply.
o A valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

As a resident in this impacted area, I urge you to intervene to stop this Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  Its harm is incalculable.
