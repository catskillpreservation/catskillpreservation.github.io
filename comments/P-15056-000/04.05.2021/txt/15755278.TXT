I oppose this project as a nearby resident and supporter of nature conservation. This project is not suitable for this part of the Catskills, including that the Ashokan Reservoir is critical to supplying drinking water for nine million residents of New York City, and that it would have a negative environmental impact on several wild trout streams and the trout in the Ashokan Reservoir itself.
