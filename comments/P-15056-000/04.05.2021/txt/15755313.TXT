 We must ask people to use less energy not at the cost of our natural resources, wildlife and townships. This is not wanted here and goes against what makes upstate NY do precious. We already feed water to the NYC and get little back for it. Enough is enough! I and many of my friends are totally against this proposal and will fight it to the end. Thank you for your ear.
