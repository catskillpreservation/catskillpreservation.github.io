I am writing concerning the proposal for the Ashokan Reservoir pumped storage project. I am a member of Croton Watershed Chapter of the national conservation organization Trout Unlimited.  There are 625 members of the Croton Watershed chapter who live in the Hudson Valley area in NY State.  Although we do not live in Ulster County, NY, many of us travel to Ulster to fly fish for trout in the Esopus Creek and other Catskill streams.  When we travel to fish the Esopus, we purchase food and lodging in the nearby towns in Ulster.  Right now tourism generates more than $600 million dollars and 15% of jobs in Ulster County and fishing/outdoor recreation contributes a large share to the tourism dollars and jobs.  The pumped storage project by pumping and releasing the turbid water from and into the Ashokan and mixing the normally stratified layers of cooler and warmer water has the potential to make the Esopus Creek, a turbid warmer water stream that would destroy the trout fishery.  This would be a serious detriment to those of us who travel from out of the area to fish in the Esopus and would have large impact on the recreational tourist spend and jobs maintained  in the area. Furthermore, pumped storage is not an efficient way of green energy generation because it is a net consumer of energy. Our Trout Unlimited Chapter joins with the others who have expressed the opinion that this project should not be approved because of its detrimental impact on outdoor sports recreation/tourism that generates dollars and jobs for the region from individuals in and traveling to the region from elsewhere in NY.  When local economies are already staggering from the effects of COVID, a project like this that will destroy a major local recreational tourist business should not be allowed to go forward.   Sincerely,  Fred Robin, Croton Watershed Chapter, Trout Unlimited
