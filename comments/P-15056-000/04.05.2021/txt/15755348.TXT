I'm am the retired Director of Water Research of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation. In that capacity I worked on establishing the NYC Watershed Filtration Avoidance under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The FAD was recently extended for ten years in 2017. It is my professional opinion that the FAD would need to be renegotiated with USEPA before even preliminary work on this project could proceed. I suggest that FERC consult with EPA and delay any preliminary investigations undertaken as part of this project.
