I'm writing to say this preliminary permit should NOT be approved. The Forever Wilds clause means these lands should remain untouched in perpetuity. As a long-time fisherman throughout the Catskills, my family has treasured the pristine lands that have been gifted to us by past generations and we owe it to future ones to keep them that way.
