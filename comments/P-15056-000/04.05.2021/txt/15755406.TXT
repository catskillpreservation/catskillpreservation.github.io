Re: Docket P-15056-000
MOTION TO INTERVENE of Sandra E. Friedel for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056


Dear Secretary Bose,

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Sandra E. Friedel is filing a motion to be an intervener and meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commissionâ€™s regulations to be granted full party status.

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project (Wittenberg Reservoir) would mean that I would lose my home and access to my property. Therefore, I have substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 65 Friedel Drive that is directly off Moonhaw Road, West Shokan, NY 12494.

Sandra E. Friedel respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion
to intervene.

Respectfully,

Sandra E. Friedel
