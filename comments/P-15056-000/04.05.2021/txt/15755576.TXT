Dana Chaifetz  Docket Number P-15056-000

April 

Dear Ms Bose,

I implore FERC to reject the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.. This project is wrong and immoral for so many reasons. 
This is a danger to the NY water supply .It will displace residents and tourists. 
This land is protected by the constitution and is legally preserved to be forever wild.
The land is used and enjoyed by many and contributes to the quality of life for residents and tourists. It would be terribly destructive and damaging to the environment and equally as disruptive and damaging to our local communities. 

In short, this project has no place here. It must be built elsewhere. 
Please, do whatâ€™s right and do not allow this terrible project to ruin what we have preserved here-  truly sacred land.

Sincerely ,
Dana Chaifetz
