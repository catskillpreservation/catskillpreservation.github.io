As a resident of NYC, and as someone who studies the history of NYC's drinking water watershed, I strongly oppose the development of the pumped storage project at Ashokan Reservoir. This project will undeniably compromise the health and quality of the water supply of NYC and the other upstate towns that rely on the water from the Catskill water system. The current restrictions on development within the Catskills are there for a reason, to protect the water. Energy and electricity can be found and produced in other ways and means, but water —and especially water of the quality that is in the watershed— cannot be so easily found. Since the late 1800s water stewards have fought to find and maintain clean drinking water for NYC, why should this project compromise decades of work.

Sincerely,

Shona Hurst
