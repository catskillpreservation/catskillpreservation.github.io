As a lifelong resident of the Catskills who grew up directly on the Ashokan Reservoir, I'm devastated by the potential of the environmental and social havoc this project will have on the Catskills. For a company not based in the area, they can't don't have any notion of the importance of the Catskills and the Forever Wild environment. We CANNOT allow special interest groups to invade our towns and land with the clear intention to destroy the precious land which has been protected for so long and needs to be preserved for future generations. We cannot allow our communities to be destroyed.

Thank you,
