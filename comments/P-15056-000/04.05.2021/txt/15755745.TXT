Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
I am a resident of the Hudson Valley and Catskills area and would like to register my opposition to a project under your consideration, Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. I ask that this permit be denied based the concerns that follow, along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and other concerned citizens. 
First, Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices and reliability. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy for a project that would deeply disrupt the Forever Wild areas as well as protected species.

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage but cannot depend upon the deceptive information provided by Premium Energy for this project. In addition, the proposed locations for this project are in the habitat of threatened species, Forever Wild areas and Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your consideration of these concerns as you review the permits for this project.

Sincerely,
Gretchen Hildebran
