RE: FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA.


Hello,
I'm reaching out to express my disapproval of the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New Yorkâ€™s Catskill Mountains. Our preserved land would be negatively impacted, along with private property owners who are already facing extreme uncertainty during the COVID pandemic and potentially negative consequences to NYC's main water source. Not to mention, tourism in the area could suffer as people like me are dismayed by the development disrupting one of my most favorite areas near the Ashokan Reservoir.

Please do not let this proposal, or others like it, go forward.

Thank you
