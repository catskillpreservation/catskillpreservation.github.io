I live within 1 mile of the Ashokan Reservoir. I oppose this ill-conceived, reckless proposal. While its intention may be noble, its implementation on the ground, or under it, would be disastrous for the environment, for New York City's water supply, and for the locals like myself who live nearby. The Ashokan Reservoir is a beautiful, protected part of our town and a major source of clean water for New York City. This proposal would violate our state's constitution which protects our reservoir. It would have a terrible impact on the lives of those of us who live nearby. And it would endanger the purity of the water that New York City relies on. I believe in alternative source of energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. However, this is not a good alternative. Please respect our protected lands and water and reject this proposal. Thank you, Zachary Sklar
