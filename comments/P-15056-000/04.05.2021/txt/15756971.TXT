Dear Ms. Bose,

I urge FERC to decline the Premium Energy Holdings request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to the local communities and risky for the purity of NYC's drinking water.

Sincerely ans Respectfully,
