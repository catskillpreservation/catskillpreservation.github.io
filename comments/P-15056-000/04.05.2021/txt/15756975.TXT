Docket number P-15056-000

Ms. Bose,

Please help keep the Catskills as wild as they currently are. You have a great power yielded unto you by your position and title, and I implore and beg you to please keep the Catskill Forest forever wild. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the NY State Constitution bans the sale of land and removal and sale of trees but from a fundamental level of common sense, the proposal would strip the land and its people of the one commonality they all share, a deep and abiding passion for the Catskill Forest.

It would be irresponsible and downright negligent if the proposed dam by Premium Energy Holdings is allowed to pass. It would destroy the very character of the “Preserve.” This beautiful land would no  longer be preserved - it would be exploited.

One pocket of land here, another patch of land there, another few hundred acres here. This is a slippery slope that will hurt the land, it’s communities, nature itself, and benefit a company 3,000 miles away.

I urge you to please keep these lands forever wild, and forever beautiful.


Best,

Andrew Konzelmann
