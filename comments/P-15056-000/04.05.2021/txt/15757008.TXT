Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,

I am writing in solidarity with the Catskills community opposing the proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. 

While there is a need for clean energy and pumped storage, I share the concern that these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species, Forever Wild areas and Status 1 protected land.

A site where the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy.

As a frequent visitor to this community, and in solidarity with those living there, I ask that you deny this permit based on these points.

Thank you for your time,

Sincerely,
Eva Armour
