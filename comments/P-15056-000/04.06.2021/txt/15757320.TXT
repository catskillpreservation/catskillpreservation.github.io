Here are a few reasons why this is a bad idea, and why people around the area dont want this to happen - 

1 - This is preserved land.  I didn't move into the middle of the mountains to have  a hydro electric plant ruining the ambiance.  its a state park preserve.  It should be kept that way.  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

2 - If you do move forward with this - the changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves are of the Catskills must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.

3 - This will impact the NYC water supply as its about 40% of the water it receives.  If a hydro electric power station is developed NYC residents may not be able to get the supplies they need

4 - Tourism and parks land generates 17% of the regions employment.  I for one would not want to go to a state park and see an ugly power supply station.  without the tourist - there isnt a reason to have these people employed.  

5 - This is an add on project and not a closed loop project.  The environmental impact of this could be HUGE.  Stating that the project is closed loop is just incorrect.  Please see plans and their own provided materials as to why this is an add on project.  

Thanks, 
Dave
