I OPPOSE THE

ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT

This is not a "green" project.
	That is a false claim of clean energy.

This project will harm recreational and 2nd home values.
	These two industries are drivers of the Catskill regional economy.

This project will harm water quality.
	The Catskill watershed is vital to the health of New York City. 

This project will disrupt local water wells.

This project will harm Quality of Life of the inhabitants of Catskill towns, villages, and rural areas.
