It has come to my attention that a California company, Premium Energy, has filed for a permit to create a hydroelectric power plant on the Ashokan Reservoir property. Within this proposal are 3 different site proposals for an upper reservoir (only one will be chosen). One of these sites is in Woodland Valley. The fact that they would be making a dam at the bottom of a dead end road would impact and flood residential neighborhoods, roads, delicate watersheds, NYC drinking water, recreation, trout spawning streams and the flow of traffic on a very narrow road with big trucks, polluting a pristine nature preserve and the Catskills State Park at the end of the road.

As a member of the Woodland Valley association and a citizen volunteering in Cornell Extension's program to monitor and eradicate invasive species along the stream, I oppose this short-sighted plan that will have a significant adverse impact on the eco-system, permanently altering the natural setting, water quality, public lands, wildlife and communities.
