Dear Ferc,

Please do not approve Premium Energy’s plan to build their hydroelectric dam in the Catskills! If you do, you’ll be setting a dangerous precedent that will allow & encourage private companies to pillage this Status One protected land for their own profit for years to come. Do you really want to pave the way to the potential annihilation of one of New York State’s (and this county’s!) most pristine wildlife and forest preserves?
