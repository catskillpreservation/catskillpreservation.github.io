Re:  Docket Number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing regarding the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  I have lived in Woodland Valley for 25 years and own a small home here.  My son attended the Phoenicia elementary school, and the Onteora middle/ high school in Boiceville.

Phoenicia is a lovely town and is becoming more and more popular as a tourist destination.  Woodland Valley is an integral part of the Phoenicia community, and the trails and campground located here are an important draw to the area.  It would be devastating to the residents here and damaging to the local economy if this project were to happen here.
As part of the Catskill Park, we prioritize maintaining the natural area that we live in, and the habitat we provide for wild animals.  This is part of what draws people here, and it would be endangered by the proposed project.

The larger community we are part of, the Onteora School District, suffered a great trauma when the community of Olive was destroyed to build the Ashokan Reservoir.  That harm has had long-lasting effects on our community and should not be repeated.

It is unclear to me at this moment whether I would lose my home should this project be approved, but it is clear that many of my neighbors would.  It is important for you to understand from the outset that the members of this community will unite in strong opposition to this project and do whatever we can to stop it.

Thank you for your consideration of our concerns,

Carolyn Mow
