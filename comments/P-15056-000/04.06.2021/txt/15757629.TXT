I am dismayed and distressed to learn that my town and the site of my home is being considered for a hydroelectric plant. Not only am I concerned as a homeowner who would  lose their home, in the event I did not lose my home I am concerned as a mother of a young child as I do not know what the impact of being so near such a plant would be. I am further concerned since I spend time in New York City and count on having clean drinking water which comes from Lanesville watershed. I cannot imagine it is a plant would be safe for the city water which I also count on. Additionally, I travel  Route 214 daily and cannot imagine being cut off from the rest of the world were this plant to destroy my means of travel.  Not to mention the economic impact on this region which relies on tourists who travel the scenic route from Phoenicia and Woodstock to skiing at Hunter. Finally, my neighbors have owned their homes some of them for decades some for centuries and I canâ€™t imagine where they will go. They depend on the forest for logging or they depend on route 214 to connect them with the ski mountain where most of the economy is focused. To cut off this route would be unspeakably detrimental. With the value of property has raised so much in the last year there is no place else for people to live. I personally have poured my savings into my house and cannot imagine I could find anything comparable that I could afford given the current market. I am troubled and disgusted by the larger environmental impacts such a project would have especially when our community would reap none of the benefits since the electricity would be shipped to Orange County. I think even a proposal of putting the plant here is shameful and incredibly shortsighted.
