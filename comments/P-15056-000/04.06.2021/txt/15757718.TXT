Re: Docket P-15056-000
MOTION TO INTERVENE of Michelle Friedel for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

Dear Secretary Bose,

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Therefore, Michelle Friedel is filing a motion to be an intervenor and meet the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commissionâ€™s regulations to grant them full party status.

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project which encompasses the  private property where one of the proposed site projects would be located- Wittenberg Reservoir/Dam. Hence, Michelle Friedel along with her children will lose and not have access to their land as well as to their home which leads them to have substantial interest in the matter, since the property is their primary residence which is located on 55 Friedel Drive that is directly off  Moonhaw Road, West Shokan, NY 12494. 

Michelle Friedel respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Respectfully,

Michelle Friedel
PO Box 35
