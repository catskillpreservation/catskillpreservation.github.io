Madam Secretary:
The Town of Hurley respectfully requests intervener status with regard to the proposed pumped storage facility by Premium Energy Holdings of Walnut, California, for the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir.  
The project will have direct impact on the Town of Hurley as the electrical lines will run through the Town and terminate at the storage facility on Hurley Avenue.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
