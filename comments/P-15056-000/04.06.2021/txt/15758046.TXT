This proposal is unacceptable on many levels. it will be a years long construction project with hundreds of trucks moving thousands of tons of materials along quiet country roads, will require the state taking property by eminent domain, and will disrupt the lives of virtually all of the people who live in the town of olive for many years.

please do not approve this proposal.

thank you
