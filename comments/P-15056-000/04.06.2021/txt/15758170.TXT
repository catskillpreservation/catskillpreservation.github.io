Hello. We strongly oppose the ill-conceived and ecologically destructive idea of this project. We live in West Shokan and most of the hamlets residents live within the area that would be impacted. It is also hard to conceive that a threat of this nature to the most important drinking water source for much of southern NYS would even be considered.
