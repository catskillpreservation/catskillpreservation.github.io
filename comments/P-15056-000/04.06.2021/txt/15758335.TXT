To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Heidi Emrich and I am a resident of West Shokan, NY in the Bushkill / Maltby Hollow / Whittenburg Stream neighborhood.  

Our recent discovery of the proposed Pump Project (FERC Project NO. 15056-000) which includes the building of a dam in one of three regions in our beautiful Catskills and 13-17 miles of transmission line, has us EXTREMELY alarmed.  Folks live here because we enjoy a peaceful life in harmony with nature.  And while we recognize the need for renewable energy sources, damming up our streams is not an environmentally-sensitive solution.
 
There is significant research about the detrimental and irreversible effects of dams.

Our communities are FULL of critical environmental resources, wetlands ecosystems, rare habitats, threatened and endangered plants and wildlife.  Our communities are also full of active community members who frequent our parks, trails, local swimming holes and other recreational resources.  Our communities are also beautiful and thriving. Plain and Simple. Home sales are up, neighborhoods are growing and folks are investing time and money into restoring our beautiful rural heritage. 

In addition to environmental concerns and impacts of dam-building, our family is terrified of the possibility of large transmission lines running through our front or back yard. Our home is RIGHT in line with one of the proposed models. We have not invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our home and landscaping improvements, all to see our property value decreased. 

Please listen to the community. The Town of Olive Residents do NOT want this, we don't need it. We haven't commissioned it. In fact, we didn't even know about it until late February!? How can a company from California come in and even propose such a project that the Community/County isn't asking for/commissioning?  This company is obviously in the business of making money- and they looked at some topographic and hydrogeological maps and picked us to be their guinea pigs.  

Everyone is scared this will steamroll its way in and our voices wonâ€™t be heard and our landscape will be forever changed. 


Thank you,
