Docket Number P-15056-000
Subject: FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA
To Secretary Kimberly D. Bose:
My opposition to the proposed project by Premium Energy is made on the following basis. First and foremost, Section 1 of Article XIV of the New York State Constitution makes such a proposal within the Catskill Park Preserve unconstitutional. “Section 1. The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.” There are these facts to also consider:
•	It would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
•	It would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents.
•	There is really no reason for it other than the fact that some spineless energy executives from California are trying to generate revenue where my family has spent our lives fishing, camping, and hiking. 
•	Apologies for my language but it is also a fact that Premium Energy can absolutely fuck right off with their assertion that this is a “closed loop” project and will not have significant environmental impacts. We are not stupid.
