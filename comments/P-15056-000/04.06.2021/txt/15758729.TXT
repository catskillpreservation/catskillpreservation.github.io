New York City's watershed should not be threatened with a hydroelectric plant. Any infrastructure with machinery, along the shores of the reservoir is a potential threat for lubrication spills, construction spills and deterioration. Why threaten the watershed when there is so much potential for wind and solar closer to NYC and offshore?!? Deny this application.
