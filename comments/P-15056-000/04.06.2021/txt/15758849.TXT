Hello, I am writing to share my concerns about the plan with Premium Energy Holdings to erect a hydroelectric power plant. The Catskill Mountains are a critical habitat that must be protected from this kind of disruption. As a NY taxpayer and frequent visitor to the Catskills (and surrounding businesses) this change is alarming to me personally, as well as to my sense of communal wellbeing. 

Green energy is an crucial goal, but doing so in a way that further harms the environment and community is not a step forward, but a step backâ€”and one that sets a precedent for further harm.

I implore FERC to reject Premium's request for a prelim permit (for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056).
