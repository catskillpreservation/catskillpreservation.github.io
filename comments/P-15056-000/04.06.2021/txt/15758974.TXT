Docket #P-15056

The proposed pumped storage hydroelectricity facility in the Catskills is immediately on the boundaries of land protected by the "Forever Wild" clause of the New York State Constitution, and will obviously have an adverse impact on those lands. More generally, the Catskill park is one giant gem, no part of which should be disturbed by such a project.

Moreover, pumped storage is an inefficient way to replace fossil fuels. Its benefit is that it levels demand, making it possible to avoid building new generating facilities. However, the existing generating facilities still require more energy to pump the water uphill. Even if that energy is clean, it could have gone directly to consumers.

Whether or not FERC has jurisdiction over this question, you must act in accordance with reality. Our environmental crisis will not be solved until the population stops growing. It is not sufficient to say that such a facility could be built elsewhere. If we don't halt population growth, the alternate, less-damaging locations will all be utilized, and the problem will still not be solved, because the population will still be growing. World population growth must be stopped, or civilization will collapse.

I would also like to know what part of our U.S. Constitution grants FERC jurisdiction over such a project as this to begin with. It's a local supplement to the power supply.

The Yards Creek pumped storage project closed part of New Jersey's most beautiful park, Worthington State Forest, to the public. Don't let this happen to the Catskills.
