Hello, 

I'm writing in opposition to this proposal from Premium Energy Holdings. The Ashokan Reservoir is more than a source of water. It is a source of peace and restoration and awe for visitors and sustenance for various habitants. 


This plan will do damage environmentally and monetarily. The plans will impact vegetation, animal life, and access to trails and roadways. The people who flock to the Reservoir and  the promenade for photos, breathtaking views, and appreciation of our landscape will also be negatively impacted. 

I oppose it and hope you grant intervenor status to the various groups and interests seeking to have a voice.

Regards,
Fran Melmed
