I am writing in reference to docket P-15056, the Proposed pumped-storage hydro plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York State.  This proposal is problematic in any number of ways.  The Catskill land involved is a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and designated as either "Forever Wild" or "Wildlands."  The construction of the proposed reservoirs will be environmentally destructive, as will the necessary additional powerlines involved.  Native flora and fauna will be severely impacted, and there will be an increased risk of the introduction of invasive species into this environmentally sensitive area. The project will significantly increase the turbidity of New York City's drinking water (increased turbidity is already a local concern with the reservoir's periodic releases into the Esopus Creek). The vital tourist economy of the area will be adversely affected, as will the citizens of the neighboring towns and villages.  It is difficult to believe that Premium Energy has done any preliminary investigation of the multiple, disqualifying issues surrounding this project.  I strongly urge that you reject this application.
