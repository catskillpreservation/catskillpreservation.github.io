The pumped storage project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California near the Ashokan Reservoir is ill-conceived and should not be constructed within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve. This proposed project would directly threaten the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, and the quality of the New York City water supply. It seems that no local stakeholders were consulted before the proposal was submitted, and the nature of the area was not considered. Please do not allow this project to go forward.
