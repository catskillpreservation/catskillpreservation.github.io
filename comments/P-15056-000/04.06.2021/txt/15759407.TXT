I am writing to express my strong distain for Premium Energy Holdings diabolical plan to destroy our community. Perhaps this is an inflammatory way to begin a comment. Well...this is a highly inflammatory plan.

The idea of a California company coming in, displacing lifelong residents of our area, simply for their profit, is criminality. I don't know how to properly articulate how evil this is. My family and our community will be fighting this tooth and nail. 

This plan has the potential to be catastrophic for the Catskills and potentially dangerous for NYC residents who drink from the Ashokan reservoir. This is pure Capitalist greed under the thin guise of environmentalism. We live around a protected nature reserve. How is this not the most slippery slope imaginable? How will this effect tourism? How will this effect the balance of our fragile ecosystem, the trout breeding grounds, the habitats this will destroy. 

There is no possible justification for this plan moving forward. None. This must end now.
