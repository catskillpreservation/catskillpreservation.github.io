I would encourage you to deny this permit as although it is a renewable energy tactic the impact on the environment would be extremely detrimental. It will not only impact views and access to this NY State Preserve but will also negatively impact local wildlife and harm NYC water supply access. I do not believe the impact outweighs the reward and while we should continue to embrace renewable energy sources there needs to be a balance with impact on the natural world. We cannot get back what we lose. Thank you.
