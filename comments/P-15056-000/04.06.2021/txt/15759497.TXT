Basis for Intervening:
Ulster County Planning Department: Reasons to Intervene

Overview of Department Responsibilities: The Ulster County Planning Department is a regional planning entity that exercises planning functions that include review and approval of land use projects, comprehensive plans and zoning statutes in the Project area.  In addition, the Department provides oversight and planning for housing, economic development, agriculture, and environmental protection.  The Project, as proposed, has the potential to have significant impacts across nearly all of the Department’s areas of responsibility.
  
The Department is also host agency for the Ulster County Transportation Council, a federally recognized Metropolitan Planning Organization that is responsible planning and programming the use of federal funds for transportation infrastructure within the Project area. Project construction may have significant impacts on the transportation infrastructure. Of particular concern is transporting large pieces of equipment over critical corridors as well as the impact on local roads and bridges. 

The Department is also a member of the Ulster County Water Quality Coordinating Committee and the Ashokan Release Working Group.  These entities have a responsibility for the protection of water quality in the Project area.   Specifically, the Department is currently engaged in commenting on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in relation to turbid discharges from the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir to the Lower Esopus Creek.  

The Project is proposing to utilize the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir as a lower reservoir. The West Basin is designed as a settling basin to capture and hold turbid water to allow the colloidal clays of the Catskills to settle out thereby protecting the City of New York’s Water Supply.  To further protect the water supply, discharges for operational and flood control purposes are made from the West Basin to the Lower Esopus. The operation of the pumped storage facility is highly likely to disrupt the normal settling pattern and timeframes in the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir and the length of the turbid discharges to the lower Esopus. These turbid discharges to the lower Esopus impact fish and wildlife, and economic opportunities along approximately 30 miles of the Creek.
  
It should be noted, that reduction in turbidity and improved flood control associated with the operation of the Ashokan Reservoir as it relates to the Lower Esopus Creek is subject to an order on consent by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.  In addition, the Catskill Turbidity Control Program (CTCP) is part of the Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) issued by US EPA that allows New York City to avoid filtration of its water supply. This program initiated the use of the measures described above to ensure the protection of the City water supply.  The Project effects of increasing the length of time turbid water remains in the Ashokan Reservoir may alter the operational requirements under the CTCP and impact the public water supply systems located in Ulster County that draw water from the Ashokan Reservoir through the Catskill Aqueduct as well as those drawing water from the 
Current data suggests that turbid discharges to the Lower Esopus which drains to the Hudson River impact the drinking water filtration systems that draw water from the Hudson River requiring additional filtration costs.  The Project is likely to lengthen the amount of time that turbid water will be present and discharged to the Hudson River through the lower Esopus to impact these facilities.

The Ashokan Reservoir is an important recreational destination for Ulster County’s strong tourism based economy.  The County recently completed the Ashokan Rail Trail that has drawn over 200,000 visitors in its first year of operation.  In addition, recreational fishing is permitted on the Ashokan that includes the use of non-motorized boats.  Finally, significant important views of the Catskill are available at the Reservoir site.  The Project's impacts on these activities during construction and operation are unknown at this time. 

The Catskill Park where the Project is located is a refuge for many threatened and endangered species. Active acquisition by New York City to protect its water supply and regional and national environmental groups is ongoing within the Project area.  In addition, New York State continues to acquire lands in the area that are protected under the New York State Constitution as forever wild.  Various land use controls and practices exist to protect lands that remain in private ownership. The proposed locations for the upper reservoirs may encroach on these protected areas and even if they do not may significantly impact the ecosystems that exist in these areas of the Catskill Park. 

Wherefore, Dennis Doyle Director of the Ulster County Department of Planning, respectfully requests that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings.
