I am opposed to the permitting, licensing, or construction of a hydroelectric plant in the Catskills of New York.
(1)	That region is “forever wild” under the New York State constitution
(2)	That facility and its associated transmission wires would deface the land, disrupt the wild environment, and negatively impact the lives of residents and tourists
(3)	That facility may affect the water supply system to New York City.
