As a resident of West Shokan and New York City I have strong objections to this application based on damage that could be done to the environment upstate as well as my drinking water downstate.

This proposal is an add on project and not a closed loop system as the report claims. I'm not sure why Premium Energy is obfuscating the fact that this is not the FERC desired closed loop project but it surely raised some red flags.

The dmage this will do to a status 1 protected NY forest is huge. I understand this technology is required for sustainable energy projects but it cannot be done in the catskill forest.
