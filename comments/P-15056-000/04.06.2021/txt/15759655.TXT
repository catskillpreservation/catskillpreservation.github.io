I am a New York State licensed attorney and a 30 year resident of Olivebridge, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity.   I am writing to vigorously object to the proposal and I hereby request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, have a devastating impact on protected wildlife and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Please do not permit this to go forward - this proposed project, if permitted will cause  permanent and irreparable  damage.

Thank you.
