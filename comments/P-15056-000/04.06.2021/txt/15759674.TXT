Please deny the request to build a hydro electric plant at Ashokan Reservoir. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYCâ€™s drinking water.
It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.
Thank you!
