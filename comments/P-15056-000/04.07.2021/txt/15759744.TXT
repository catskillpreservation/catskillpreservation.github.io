As a Saugerties resident and frequent hiker and paddler, I oppose the granting of a preliminary license for this proposal. This project is not in the best interest of the people or the environment of the Hudson Valley, and it is so wrong that no local stakeholders have been consulted on it. The Catskill Forest Preserve is beloved and State Constitutionally protected, which should not be taken lightly.

This project would irreversibly harm sensitive ecosystems we have long fought to protect throughout the Preserve, from the powerline right-of-ways to the dams and the powerhouse itself. It will also likely lead to the introduction of even more invasive species. During and after construction, hikers will be denied access to the trails and views that are part of our New York heritage. Many of these hikers will be diverted to other trails that are already struggling under overuse and cannot withstand further ecological degradation. Depending on the location, roads will have to be rerouted, causing even more disruption to people and our forest land.

I support the shift to renewable energy, and we need to do it intelligently. Pumped storage is a net consumer of energy, not a producer of it. It doesn’t make sense to cause all this disruption in an ecologically rich and sensitive area for a project that isn’t actually moving us forward. There is no upside for our forests and waterways in this proposal, and there is no upside for all of us trail users from near and far. At the very least, this proposal needs serious consideration and input from all municipalities affected by it before the FERC grants any preliminary license.
