I am writing my concerns regarding the proposed hydroelectric plant at Ashokan Reservoir, submitted by Premium Energy. This proposal should not be considered without input from New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and local leaders and stakeholders. 
If Premium Energy had consulted with the above groups, they likely would not have proposed building the hydroelectric plant in a Forever Wild area. Any amendment to a Forever Wild area should be carefully considered, considering the loss of extremely valuable habitat, species, and water supply protection these lands provide. Additionally, any historic structures in the vicinity of the proposal should be studied carefully and avoided if possible, before the proposal even initially proceeds. 
It seems the Premium Energy has not carefully considered the location of the hydroelectric plant from the onset of the project and does not value the input of local stakeholders. Please hold Premium Energy accountable for providing the state of New York a project that provides clear benefits and considerations to the environment and people.
