As a local resident who often visited the Catskills and the Ashokan reservoir for recreational purposes, I'm dismayed that an out-of-state company would consider coming into the ecosystem to put up a hydro power storage station. This project will have a negative impact on the local trails, local waterways, nonhuman populations and the quality of life, quite frankly, due to construction impact. There must be suitable locations in California to consider siting this project.
