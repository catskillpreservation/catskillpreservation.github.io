Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose:
I am writing to request that this application be rejected on the basis that it contains a serious defect. The applicants rely upon the designation of this project as a closed loop system which it is not.
 
Premium Energy Holdings’ Application for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project states the project would “operate in a closed loop. Aside from evaporation and percolation losses, [the proposal claims] the project’s water would stay within the system.” The Project proposes to use the existing Ashokan Reservoir as a lower pool and a new reservoir in the Catskill Mountains to serve as the upper pool.
  
U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Water Power Technologies Office defines closed-loop PSH as “not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature” and open-loop Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) as “continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature.”(1)

The Ashokan Reservoir, which is proposed to be the lower reservoir of the system, receives water from the Esopus Creek.  Although streamflow in the Esopus is altered by diversion of water from the Schoharie Creek watershed to the Esopus Creek through the Shandaken Tunnel, overall, the Esopus Creek continues to be a naturally flowing water feature with estimates of natural discharge reflecting the absence of effects of flows in the Esopus Creek over broad time frames.(2)

Water from the Ashokan Reservoir flows naturally, by gravity, into a system of reservoirs, and ultimately into New York City’s distribution system.(3) Importantly, there is a continuous flow of water out of the Ashokan Reservoir into the Lower Esopus.(4)

Therefore, the proposed lower reservoir for the system is continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature, the Esopus Creek.  The designation of this project as a closed loop system, a critical distinction in the review process, is defective and the proposal should be rejected on this basis.

Sincerely
Dr. Jennifer L. Costley
