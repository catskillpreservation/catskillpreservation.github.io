The Ashokan reservoir is located in the middle of The Catskills state park area.  It is a unique and environmentally fragile location that serves as New York Cities drinking water supply as well as a vital green space in an area of ever increasing urban sprawl.  

The trails, vast forests and fragile ecosystems that would be damaged by this project are seemingly endless. 

As a resident of the Catskills I ask that you deny this permit.
