This proposed project is not good for the Catskills.
It was submitted with no input from New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), or from local leaders and stakeholders.
•	The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
•	The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
•	The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
•	The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
•	This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
•	It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
•	Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
•	The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
