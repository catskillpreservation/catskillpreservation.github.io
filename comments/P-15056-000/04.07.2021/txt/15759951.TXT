As a life long resident of the Catskills I am strongly opposed to the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. This project would ruin what makes this area so special and threatens the integrity of most amazing places. I will not stand by while my  home is under threat and I will do everything it my power to make sure this project does not go forward. These mountains must be protected for generations to come.
