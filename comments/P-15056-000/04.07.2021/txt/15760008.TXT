To whom it may concern,

Iâ€™m very concerned about the proposed hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve that would impact the Ashokan Reservoir. This proposal directly threatens the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, and the quality of the NYC water supply. In addition, it would significantly and negatively impact the use surrounding trails. As an avid trail user, this is very important to me. I strongly urge you to stand with fellow New Yorkers in disapproving this proposal. 

Thank you in advance,
Katherine Rodrigues
