To The FERC,

	I’m writing this letter in response to Premium Energy LLC’s proposal to construct a hydroelectric dam within the Catskill Forest Preserve. Although hydroelectric energy is an essential step in shaping a greener and better energy future for our country, this proposal is deeply flawed. It would have dire consequences for the state of New York. 

	The first and perhaps most pressing of these consequences would be the dam’s effect on the Ashokan Reservoir. As it stands right now, the reservoir is protected. But if the dam were approved, it would increase the turbidity and pollution in the reservoir, which supplies drinking water to 40% of New York City residents. It would be a severe moral transgression to put these citizens’ lives and health at risk just as the state is recovering from the carnage of COVID-19. 

	Additionally, in order to construct the dam, private property would have to be taken through eminent domain. This seizure of property would displace our communities that have long called the Catskills home. Thousands of Catskill residents were already displaced once when the reservoir was built; uprooting these communities again would be unjustifiably cruel. 

	And finally, the dam would wreak havoc on the highly prized and preserved forests, wildlife, and ecology of the area. Green energy is the future. But if we have to destroy our world to get there, is the energy truly green at all? 

	Thank you for taking the time to listen to my comments. I hope you find that Premium Energy’s dam does not meet the bar for sustainable green energy and reject their proposal. 

Best regards,
Graham Brown
