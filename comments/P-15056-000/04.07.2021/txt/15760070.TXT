It has come to my attention that there has been an application with the intended end of creating a "pumped storage" project on lands that currently serve the public good for residents of New York State.  The land identified for the project is a State preserve protected by the NY State constitution.  The proposed changes will not only threaten local wildlife and ecosystems, but will remove valuable outdoor recreation opportunities from the citizens of the local communities.  Additionally the proposed changes will negatively impact the drinking water which is consumed by myself and my children.  

An organization of which I am a member, the NYNJ Trail Conference, is seeking status as an intervenor.  I would like to register my support for that application as well as register my opposition to the proposal as it stands.
