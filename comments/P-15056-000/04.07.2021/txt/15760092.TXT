I am writing in concern with the Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California has proposed a pumped storage hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever WildÂ lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve. This facility would have a significant negative impact on the lands by eliminating vital  access to popular trailheads and recreation areas. Closing these areas would put undue strain on the remaining trailheads and would magnify negative ecological impacts seen by increased trail use during the pandemic.  As a trail maintained I am significantly concerned with the negative impact on the various habits and ecosystems that are currently protected as a State preserve by the NY State constitution. The construction of these new dams would irreversibly damage the native flora and fauna which make the state preserve such a treasured place in our community. Furthermore, this project would have a significant impact on tourism and the business revenue which benefits from this. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
