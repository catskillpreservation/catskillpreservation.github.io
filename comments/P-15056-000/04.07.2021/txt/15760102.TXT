As a lifetime resident of Ulster County, I am writing to ask you to deny the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The environmental impact this project would have on the surrounding area, not to mention the potential impact on New York City’s water supply, would be far more devastating than the benefits such a project would have to the electrical grid. 

The project proposes to use private and state land. That state land is part of the Catskill Forest Preserve, which has been designated as “forever wild” under the New York State Constitution. It is “status one” land that the Department of Energy itself says should be avoided for development.

A pumped storage facility, not to mention the years of heavy construction needed to build it, would wreak havoc on the local streams and the surrounding land habitats. It would also displace residents and have a negative impact tourism, which is a major source of jobs in the region.

Even though we undoubtedly need to upgrade our electrical grid in this country and make it more “green,” these kinds of projects do not seem to be the kinds of projects the department should be developing given they are net consumers of energy and not producers. 

Please deny the preliminary permit application by Premium Energy Holdings.

Thank you,
Ellen Carl
