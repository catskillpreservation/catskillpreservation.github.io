Re: Docket number P-15056-000, Premium Energy Proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project 

Dear Commissioners, 

I write in strong opposition to the proposed pump storage project in the Ashokan Watershed and Catskills State Preserve.  Pumped storage makes sense in very particular settings, but this is not one of them.  The ecological disruption that would be caused by this proposal, which is not a true “closed loop” system, is immense.  The real and unwarranted risks to the area include:

-	Risks to the purity of New York City’s water supply.  The Ashokan provides 40% of that supply, and would take billions of dollars to replace.

-	Disruption of the local habitat and fisheries.  Pumped storage creates major fluctuations in water levels and alters stream sediment, harming local fish and recreational fishing.

-	Damage to the Catskills Preserve.  The preserve is pristine and considered Status 1 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. These are to be avoided for development, according to the DOE’s own Hydropower Vision.  The proposal would inundate more than 200 acres for the reservoir and associated roads, dam and other infrastructure.  This would lead to carbon loss, and irreversibly impact local wildlife.  

-	Disruption of the local community.  The project would inundate much of Woodland Valley and do significant damage to tourism in an area where much of the local economy is tourism-dependent.

I support clean energy, and strongly support proposals to introduce real green energy in sensible ways.  But this cannot be the way that we green the economy.  There is nothing suitable about this setting, and we will do grave damage to the political will needed to really bring green energy about if we contemplate proposals like these.
