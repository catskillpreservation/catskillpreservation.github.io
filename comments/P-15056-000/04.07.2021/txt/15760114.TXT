To Whom It may Concern,

  The following project proposal of a Hydroelectric Plant on Ashokan Reservoir will have long lasting negative impacts for the local environment of the Catskills area. I am all for eliminating greenhouse emissions, however not at the expense of the local community. Not only will the people living nearby be at risk for possible flooding, but the habitat of the dam and land will be greatly impacted too. During the warmer season, I enjoy taking time away from the chaos of the world and going into nature whether it be hiking or fishing (catch & release). If this hydroelectric plant were to be built, hiking in that area would slowly decrease along with the fishing which will eventually also affect the feeding cycle of the ecosystem. During the colder season, I find myself enjoying winter activities at Hunter mountain. If the dam were to be built it'll impact the mountain as well. I vacation up frequently at the Catskills and enjoy the solitude the area has to offer. I am from the NJ/NYC area, if this dam were built not only would my vacation spot be greatly impacted, my hometown tap water would also be greatly impacted. Please reconsider your proposal to help maintain the sacred and already stable environment of Ashokan Reservoir. Thank you for your time.
