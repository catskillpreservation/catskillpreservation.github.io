I vote NO 

This action will impact highly preserved land

It will destroy our streams and the ecology of our streams creating filth and destruction 

The NYC water will become muddy and filthy and unhealthy

We rely on our waterways for tourism +, Catskills tourism will be destroyed !  We will experience No employment and no money for the people who live here and rely on tourism.

This is not the proper innovation that the Dept of Energy would want !


We say NO to this proposal
Thank you 
Lorraine Salluzzi
