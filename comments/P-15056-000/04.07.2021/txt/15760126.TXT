I enjoy visiting the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding Catskills and am extremely concerned about the impact of this project. 
This land is part of a state preserve protected by the NYS constitution and the proposed project will permanently damage the its ecosystem. 
These areas are also used by New Yorkers to hike, ski, boat, fish, and more. 
Please protect these lands.
