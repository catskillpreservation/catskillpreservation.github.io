Re:  docket number P-15056-000
My partner and I live in Greene County and frequently travel through Ulster County and take advantage of recreational opportunities at the Ashokan Reservoir.  Our closest friends have lived in West Hurley for 30 years.
I oppose the proposal put forward by Premium Energy to FERC to study the feasibility of a massive program that will disrupt the Catskill State Preserve.
My principal concerns include: 
--the disruption to the lives of residents uprooted by the process of eminent domain
--ecological impact and threat to NYC drinking water due to increased turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed
--the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution (“shall be kept forever wild”)
--loss of recreational opportunity 
--Premium Energy’s fundamental justification of project as “closed loop” when in fact the upper reservoir component is clearly an “add-on”.  This is dishonest on its face.
Please deny Premium Energy’s request to proceed with a feasibility study.
