As a resident of Olivebridge, where Premium Energy Holdings company is requesting to put in a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for the use of pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and will likely damage local lands, roads, and streams. Our land is valuable and important to us. While we understand the importance of green energy, destroying parts of our town is not the way to achieve this. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal moving forward. Docket number P-15056-000
