I'm writing to oppose this application for a large and poorly conceived “pumped storage” project. It would draw from the existing Ashokan Reservoir, plus a newly created dam and reservoir at one of three alternative sites near the Ashokan.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the natural areas and have significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs. This plan would also negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms.

In conclusion, I oppose this proposal because it directly threatens the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, the quality of the New York City water supply, and so much more.
