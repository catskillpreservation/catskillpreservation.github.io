Deeply concerned about pumped-storage hydroelectric project prosed by Premium Energy Holdings in the heart of the Catskills region. I am a longtime trail user, onetime fisherwoman, and nearby homeowner. Some things just deserve being preserved: the Ashokan watershed, the streams that feed it, the trails that enable people to walk it, the wildlife and human lives that derive essential sustenance from it are among those things. The state and the public have already safeguarded the area in legislation. Please donâ€™t mess it up.
