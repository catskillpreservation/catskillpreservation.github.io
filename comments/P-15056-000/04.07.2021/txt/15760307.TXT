Basis for Intervening:
I hereby submit a motion to be an intervenor in connection with FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA.

I am a resident of West Shokan, New York, and am concerned by the application made by Premium Energy to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the vicinity of my home and in the vicinity of the natural resources of the Catskills, which I and my family use and enjoy and which are tourist attractions that create sorely needed revenues for the local community.
