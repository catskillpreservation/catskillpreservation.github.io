I am writing to express concern about the environmental impacts that would be caused by this proposal to build a new hydroelectric dam in the Catskills. Dams and construction of dams have an overwhelmingly negative impact on native flora and fauna, disrupting the ecosystems of precious wildlife in the area. Additionally, building on the Ashokan reservoir will negatively impact the drinking water that comes from there, particularly in NYC where I live. I believe it is important to protect our natural resources and wildlife, and that the permit application for this hydroelectric dam should be immediately denied.
