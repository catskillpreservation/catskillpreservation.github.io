I am appalled that the Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California has supplied documents without input from the NYCDEP and the NYSDEC concerning the impact of their plans on the area around the Ashokan Reservoir. Water, land, people and wildlife in protected areas will be adversely affected.

 I am a resident of Croton on Hudson, a  neighbor of one of NYC's reservoirs, and a hiker, canoer and visitor of the wonderful parks and rivers in the Ashokan Reservoir area. I have enjoyed this area since the late 1990's. I do not want to see the Forever Wild lands polluted,  and disrupted by noise, or have a loss of contiguous wildlife corridors.  I do not want the Catskill Forest Preserve violated by these things either.  I do not want an out of state entity having legal control over NY State's and NYC's water supply.  As my area is contiguous to the New Croton Reservoir and Croton Aqueduct this is personal.

I request that all agencies, municipalities and non-profits currently filing for intervenor status  get 
their chance to submit relevant data about the effect of these plans on the environment. I request that the comment period be extended for another 3 months. 

Thank you,
Susan Johnson
