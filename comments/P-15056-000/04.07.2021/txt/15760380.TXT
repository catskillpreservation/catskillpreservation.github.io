To whom it may concern,

As president of the High Point Neighbors Association located in West Shokan, NY, I call on FERC to stop the hydroelectric plant proposed by Premium Energy Holdings. 

I list below our initial objections to the granting of a Preliminary Permit by FERC. We feel strongly that the location, and the project overall, is not suitable or viable. Here’s why:

LEGAL ISSUES
-The are falls under Status 1 of the USGS Gap Analysis, and therefore not eligible for development.
-NYS has already expressed severe concern about this project, and it is expected that legal objections to this issue may well elevated to the Supreme Court, increasing costs for all concerned.
-The developer has been dishonest from the onset - the project is NOT closed loop, but an add-on project which is not what the DoE really wants to promote.
-The local area constitutes 700,000 acres of forest habitat and is among the top 1% region wide.  Under Article XIV of the NYS constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forests lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”.

ECOLOGICAL ISSUES
-There are several protected species that will be dramatically damaged by development of this size and impact.
-The impact on the land and streams will be significant. A DoE 2013 study found that rapid fluctuations in water levels (which this project would create) “wreak havoc on the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems overlap.”

SUITABILITY ISSUES
-Hydropower seems to be a net producer of greenhouse gasses overall - true, it reduces gasses from fossil fuels, but reservoirs create methane. The forrest area that would have to be cleared to create the project currently serves to reduce pollution, and this would be lost.
-This is a shortsighted solution from a location point of view, due to uncertainly in the climate here with the potential of a much reduced snowfall and therefore runoff.

FINANCIAL ISSUES
-Local tourism constitutes a major component of the local economy, and due to recent new hiking trails, this is increasing dramatically. This project would irreversibly reduce that revenue and therefore economically damage an area of the State that is already under pressure.

CULTURAL ISSUES
-Although we realize that FERC is not mandated to consider the human impact of proposed projects, I would be remiss if I did not mention that the area’s cultural cohesion was devised when the original Ashokan reservoir was constructed, mostly due to the use of eminent domain to obtain land, and the fragmentation of all the towns that were moved to outlying areas. The through the this will happen again would most probably create a major backlash in the area.

I appreciate your time in reviewing this letter and ask that you take into consideration when reviewing the application.

About the Association.
The association was created in 2017 by a group of West Shokan Residents, specifically to stop the use of one of the most scenic local residences as a wedding venue. The association was able to galvanize local activists, harness substantial legal funds and implement a multi-faceted public campaign. These efforts were a resounding success as the wedding venue application was subsequently dramatically restricted and no longer operates.
