I live in New City New York.

       I am contacting you regarding docket P-15056 proposed hydro electric facility in the Catskill region of New York. 

      The Catskills are a State Preserve  and are protected by the NY State Constitution. The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

      The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources.

      The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species.

      I am also opposed because the lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve and would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience in this area.
      It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming. The rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
For these and other environmental and economic reasons I am opposed to the approval of this project in the Catskill region.
