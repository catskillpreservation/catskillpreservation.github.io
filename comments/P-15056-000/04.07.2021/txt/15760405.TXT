I am a frequent visitor to Stony Clove, Greene County, NYS, having lived there for 6+ years in the 1970s, and now reside in New York City, including as President of Friends of City Hall Park.  

I vehemently oppose flooding the valley, and oppose a proposed feasibility study for same. 

Although I support renewable energy production in general and specifically for New York City, it should not be accomplished at the expense of the rare natural environment. 

You must understand that this valley has likely the cleanest air, is quietest and contains the most natural environment within 100 linear miles of NYC. This is natural land preserved to “be forever kept as wild forest lands.”

Those of us who depend on this respite from hectic urban life rely on this valley for the experience of nature, and even knowing that it’s there. 

It would be a devastating loss to not have this valley available to my family and me. 

Losing the tourist destination will demand seeking another convenient alternative… in New Jersey or Massachusetts... or further, discouraging frequent visits and diminishing my quality of life.

It would also tragically destroy important sentimental memories of my earlier life.

I IMPLORE YOU: PLEASE DO NOT PROCEED WITH A FEASIBILITY STUDY THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE VIABILITY OF FLOODING STONY CLOVE!
