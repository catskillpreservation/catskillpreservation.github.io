April 5th 2021

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the problematic proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric pumped storage plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I recommend FERC decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, and I would like to provide my professional reasons for supporting this position. 

I am a materials engineer, an engineering professor, and I run a not for profit (501c3) organization on environmental education, forest school and waste recycling. I am also a local resident and enjoy the beauty of the Catskills. My area of specialization is to consider the social and environmental impact of what engineers do, and I will adopt a similar framework to address my concerns about the proposed hydro pump storage plant, through this letter. It is clear to me and I hope to the readers of this letter, that the negative impacts far outweigh the positives overall, and that we must look closely at who benefits and who pays the cost of these negative impacts in the long term. Who pays the price for the benefit of those who gain?

The idea of pumped storage energy is ostensibly an elegant solution to the need to store energy in areas of weak or changing supply. If done well, and with no negative environmental impact, it would add immeasurably to the suite of tools and facilities currently being developed in support of a just transition away from fossil fuels, so critically necessary in our consideration of climate change and sustainability of resources. 

However, if we look at the potential negative impacts in this case we can see that these are many and they are unevenly distributed. In Table 1 (inspired by the brilliant Ursula Franklin and her ‘Real world of technology’ book by Anansi Press, 1995) a + or - sign is where there is an expected positive or negative impact, either socially, environmentally or economically. Each stakeholder group is taken separately. This table is not complete (there may be stakeholder groups not included) but the categories within serve to support the points being made in this letter. The only group to benefit long term from this project are a private, profit making Californian company. Tourism (with its associated health benefits and local jobs), NY water supply, local residents (who have been fighting the injustice of eminent domain for years), residents within the broader area (who visit the Catskills regularly for leisure and sport), the fauna and particularly the fish, the flora and the entire ecosystem will all pay the costs and suffer the neglect of an adequate and considered approach to solving the challenge of energy storage. This all despite the fact that under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that lands which include the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

Table 1 Who pays and who benefits? (The Table does not format well in this comment but I'd be happy to provide it in another format as required.) 


There are two critically important points to reinforce relating to the above. Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project claims to be a closed-loop pumped storage projects which has a smaller environmental impact than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval (although closed loop still has its problems). However this is not technically accurate. The system is not closed from local water supply – as the Esopus river runs into the reservoir. Furthermore, the water is drawn from the reservoir for the NY city water supply, which will experience hugely increased turbidity due to the changed water levels. 

I strongly urge you to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. But in addition I would stress the importance of not simply pushing the project further onto other at-risk lands. The company, and others who use this technology needs to do due diligence and research the impacts using independent researchers, to find a solution to the issue of energy storage which adopts the same elegant solution but without creating harm to the environment it had been designed to save. For centuries we have created solutions which seem to be the panacea at the time and only later have we discovered the profound damage that we have caused. Let us set a new pathway where we care for our common home. 

Sincerely, 
 
Dr Caroline Baillie, Professor, Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering, USD and director of Waste for Life/Forest Exploratorium Sullivan County, NY.
