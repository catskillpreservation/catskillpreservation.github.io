Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing today to urge you and your team at FERC to decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The information that has been made available indicates that this reservoir project and dam construction would be devastating to the place I call home. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is incredibly flawed. Bringing this to life would mean destroying our fragile ecosystem and disrupting local communities. I live in a home that was originally located in what is now the Ashokan Reservoir. The displacement of homes and people in this current climate would breed toxicity. I fear that this initiative will reignite the historical tension between the local community and the tourism that supports our area and provides NYC’s drinking water. This idea is not worth the negative long-term cost.

Here’s a bulleted list as to why this idea is flawed:

•	Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife, and ecosystem are at risk of being tampered with. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of wildlife habitat. It would be irresponsible to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
•	Pumped storage wreaks havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. My home is part of the Ashokan watershed, and I know how delicate the ecosystem is. The redirection of water would impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.
•	The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.
•	Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, which I am a part of. This project would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced. 
•	The proposed project would negatively impact the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 
•	The project would impair the connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

I could outline many more reasons, but overall, this project will directly hurt the environment, local community, and tourism. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

Sincerely,

Sherry F. Adams
