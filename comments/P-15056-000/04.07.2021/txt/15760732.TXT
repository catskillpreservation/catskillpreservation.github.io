To whom it may concern ? 

I have friends who live on and just off the road proposed for imminent domain. 

I am a huge fan of summer and winter and fall and spring Hunter area. 

It would be ludicrous to do the proposed, and quite frankly insulting that it is even a thought, no less a possibility. 

Drinking water, existing houses, one less route of ONLY two, that almost all  use to get to Hunter mountain via Thruway.  

I am a tourist to the area. 

I Visit the BEAUTIFUL park along that road. 

THAT ROAD is what makes Hunter area beautiful to arrive at.  and leave from.   One of the few useful and scenic roads to get to and leave Hunter. 

To go into Phonecia.  What about visits to Phonecia ? 

Ludicrous idea.

Don't do this folks.

I am for clean energy very much, but a responsible approach to clean energy, this is not.
