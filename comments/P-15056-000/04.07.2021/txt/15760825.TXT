I am writing in response to the flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it poses an unacceptable risk to the disruption New York City’s drinking water. 

I have heard the concerns of some folks about the possibility of enhanced water column turbidity from this proposed project, but my concern is with the potential of nutrient loading that has the potential to stimulate the outbreak of harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Given that New York City receives 40% of its water from the Ashokan Reservoir, it is imperative that the “Precautionary Principle” be invoked in this case.  Given the extreme catastrophic outcome should the waters Ashokan Reservoir become poisoned with HAB bloom toxins, the developer should be required to prove “with an extreme certainty” that HAB outbreaks would never occur.  This is a tall hurdle for the developer, but absolutely required in this case.  The HAB outbreak in the waters feeding Toledo Ohio in 2014 provides a clear word of caution for what HAB toxins can do to a public waterworks that serves a large metropolitan city.

Given the likelihood that the volume of upper reservoir will vary dramatically on a diel basis, it seems possible that in addition to resuspending bottom sediments, the process might also resuspend plant nutrients.  HABs, and associated toxins, could subsequently develop in the upper reservoir and be sent to the Ashokan and/or the suspended plant nutrients could be sent down to the Ashokan Reservoir, to stimulate HAB outbreaks directly.  This issue needs to be seriously addressed in my opinion.
