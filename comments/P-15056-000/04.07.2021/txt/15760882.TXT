Dear FERC:

	I am writing in regards to docket P-15056. Please do not approve Premium Energy Holdings of Southern Californiaâ€™s proposed pumped hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Reserve as it would have negative impacts on the Ashokan Reservoir and the surrounding area.

	The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and should be kept protected. This project endangers the water supply of NYC, would ruin the beautiful experience of visiting the area leading to a loss of tourist and business revenue for the nearby communities, and open the area to the unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction. These are but a few of the foreseen problems with such a massive construction project in this beautiful area. 

	I had the pleasure of walking the Ashokan Trail for the first time last fall with a friend. It was beautiful, and to think it might be threatened is disconcerting, to say the least. There were so many people walking the trail, enjoying the beautiful day in a beautiful setting. 

	Please do not say yes to Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California. New York State does not deserve this. 

	Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Eileen McInerney, MD
