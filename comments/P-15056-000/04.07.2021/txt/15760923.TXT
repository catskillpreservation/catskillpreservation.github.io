I own a home in Lanesville, Greene County, NY. The Stony Clove Creek intersects my property. I've worked with DEP Stream Management since Hurricane Irene to rebuild   with state-of-the art energy efficiency and grading the land to mitigate flooding. Now, my home is "ground zero" in one of the three sites that could up under 40 feet of water.
   I oppose the proposed hydropower project currently under review by FERC (docket number P-15056) because:
    1. It will destroy my home and those of my neighbors, some of whom have lives in Lanesville for many generations. Even if I were to relocate, I would still oppose the project because:
    2. It will destroy The Stony Clove Creek, a popular fishing stream and a beautiful natural tributary feeding into the Esopus.
    3. It will negatively impact the area’s popular streams for fly fishing 
    4. It will cause economic harm to residents and businesses in Hunter and Phoenicia since State Route 214 - the only road between the two - would have to somehow be relocated.
    5. If Rt 214 is not relocated:
         -- All Hunter Ski resort traffic would come off Exit 20 of the Thruway instead of 19 (right now people use both) and cut through the already treacherous winding road around Kaaterskill Falls for skiing and summer cultural events. 
         -- The road past Kaaterskill is continually clogged with illegally parked cars and pedestrians in the summer and the additional traffic will bring the area to a crawl and could result in more pedestrian injuries or fatalities. 
         -- Skiers and hikers would be cut off from traveling between towns and businesses along the state-owned Rt 28 including the Belleayre ski area and Phoenicia and the Hunter/Tannersville/Windham areas. This will have a severe impact on the local economies of these areas.   
    Please do not let this private for-profit enterprise destroy our homes, communities, way of life and natural resources.
