To whom it may concern, 

I am a lifetime resident of the hudson valley, and I enjoy our robust and beautiful ecology. I am submitting this complaint against the recent application for an energy development plant filed by Premium Energy. A corporation not even based in the state of New York. Their production facilities would reap devastating effects on the Ashokan reservoir and it's tributaries, which are guaranteed by MY tax dollars to be preserved. I implore you to cease this process before it goes any further.
