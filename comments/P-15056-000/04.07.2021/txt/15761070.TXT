Dear Ms. Bose, 

I am writing about Premium Energy Holdings’s proposal regarding the hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Mountains using the Ashokan reservoir. I know that very few people want a project like this in their own neighborhood and I do not wish to add another of those voices just for the sake of preserving our own backyards. I believe that these projects are important. However, two of the issues raised have also concerned me enough that I feel compelled to add my voice. First, our area’s status as a forest preserve and designation as Status 1 land. I believe this corroborates the idea that these lands are particularly important to preserve and are likely to not be the best fit for a project such as this proposal. Second, the concerns related to the project not actually being “closed-loop” as they claim. In part because I do actually believe in the importance of these projects, please let us hold the companies accountable to do them correctly and as the agencies and offices involved require for good reason. 

Thank you very much for your time.
