Reference:  Docket  # P-15056-000
Premium Energy Holdings, LLC has submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)  referred to as the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project  that seeks permission to do a feasibility study that would clarify the project’s scope and viability. In the proposal they call it a closed-loop project as such designs  are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.  
Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects, that’s what this really is. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project  therefore is not a closed-loop system.
 “Initial construction impacts” for these projects are lower, but operational impacts are likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the addon project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.”*

That’s why Premium Energy is claiming that the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project is to be “closed-loop.”  This is one of many reasons that this proposal should be denied.
