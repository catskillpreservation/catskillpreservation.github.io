Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Pumped Storage proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Mountains. I encourage FERC to decline this request for Project P-15056, because it would:

• Wreak havoc on a designated wildlife preserve under the protection of the New York Constitution

• Devastate the local communities as well as the tourism the Catskill mountains rely on economically

• Would harm the quality of the drinking water sourced from the Ashokan Reservoir which provides water to 40% of New York City's 9.7 million residents.



Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

David Lizmi
