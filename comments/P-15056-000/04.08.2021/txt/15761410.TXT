Re: Docket # P15056:000
Proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Hydro Plant

As a resident of Shandaken since 1998, and of NYC prior to that since 1952, I would like to vigorously object to the proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings to build a Pumped Storage facility that incorporates the Ashokan Reservoir. At the very least, this project in this place will cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in NYC. Additionally, pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. All proposed  reservoirs fall within a State Forest Preserve, considered Status 1 land by the US Geological Survey. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development”. 
Although this project is presented by Premium as Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower, this is not the case. This is an “add-on” project since it incorporates the existing Ashokan Reservoir. The danger to the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for the origin of the Ashokan can not be determined, and if negatively impacted may cause untold expenditures to correct.
As we move toward the goal of 70% renewable power by 2030, we must make sure we are selecting locations for pumped storage that will not create more environmental and economic damage than they attempt to alleviate.
