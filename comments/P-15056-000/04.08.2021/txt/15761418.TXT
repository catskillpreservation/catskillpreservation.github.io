Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing to urge you to decline Premium Energy Holdings’ request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 
Among other problems with this proposed project, it would further damage an economy and community that has been severely impacted by the New York City water supply system in its midst for over 100 years. The Ashokan Reservoir destroyed hundreds of homes, dozens of towns, and thousands of livelihoods when the it was built by eminent domain in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Ever since, the surrounding towns and their residents have been impacted daily by the existence of the reservoir, the vast tracts of land surrounding it that are not under local jurisdiction, and the vast areas beyond that that are governed by regulations of the City’s Watershed oversight agencies. 
Not only would such a plant impact our region, but it would have a negative impact on the New York City water supply, which the City has invested billions of dollars and countless oversight hours in protecting for over a century.
Sincerely,
Victoria Chesler
Olivebridge NY
