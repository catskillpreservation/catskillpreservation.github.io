Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in regard to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. This proposal is problematic and short-sighted, and I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The project, if completed, would negatively impact tourism, local communities, the area’s environment, and New York City’s drinking water.

One of the main problems is that the project will have a negative effect on tourism in the Catskills. In 2019, tourism generated 17% of the employment in the region; it is a $1.6 billion industry which supports thousands of jobs. The Catskill region is justly celebrated as a haven for hikers, fishermen, and skiers. Premium Energy’s project would cut off access to these and other forms of recreation. Furthermore, the project would irreparably damage the area’s natural beauty. With a decrease in tourism, businesses in Ulster County will suffer. 

Additionally, the project would be deeply damaging to the housing situation of local communities in the Catskills. Completion of the project would require the seizure of homes and private property via eminent domain, and displaced residents will have a difficult time finding affordable housing in the area. Ulster County is experiencing a severe housing shortage and the properties that are available are extremely expensive. Furthermore, many in the area are already struggling with loss of income due to the pandemic.

Premium Energy’s project will also cause egregious harm to the environment. Large areas of wildlife habitat are rare in our country: the Catskill Forest Preserve comprises almost 700,000 acres of contiguous habitat, and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats in the region, per the New York State Forest Condition Index. In addition, Catskill Forest Preserve lands, under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, are clearly designated as “forever. . .  wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

Finally, Premium Energy’s project is a serious threat to New York City’s drinking water. The project would make use of the already-existing Ashokan Reservoir, which serves the city and which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, providing 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. In the 1990s alone, $1.7 billion was invested in the reservoir. It would be foolish to endanger this essential resource in the ways that Premium Energy’s project proposes. Their proposed pumped storage plant would adversely affect the sediment regime in tributary rivers and streams that feed the reservoir—ultimately harming not only the fish and wildlife that depend on them but also the millions of  New York City residents who do as well.

I am in favor of renewable energy, and that I hope it will play a large part in our transition away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable sources. However, we cannot sacrifice community and environmental well-being in pursuit of this goal. Though Premium Energy claims their project is a “closed loop,” a type of pumped storage project that would have a smaller impact on the surrounding ecosystem, this is false: the project is in fact an “add on” since it would use an existing body of water, the Ashokan, as a lower reservoir. In putting the project forward as a “closed loop,” Premium Energy has already lied to us. How can we trust them to maintain high standards and care for the community if they have based their proposal on a falsehood?

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Christopher Tyler
