I am a full-time resident of the Catskills. I am also a hiker and birder who enjoys the Catskills on a daily basis. I write to strongly oppose this ill-considered and damaging project.

The proposal is located within the Catskill Park, a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The park consists of over 600,000 acres of forest and wilderness land within easy driving distance of millions of residents in metropolitan New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Visitors come to enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, hunting and nature study They also come to experience solitude, quiet contemplation and rejuvenation. 
 
The proposed reservoirs are especially troubling. They will permanently prevent hiker access to mountains in the Burroughs Range, disrupt traffic on the only route north-south highway through the region, and prevent access to campgrounds and trout streams.  Loos of access to one area would result in overuse in others, and the pandemic has already caused a tectonic shift in use levels. This would directly impact hundreds of thousands of visitors and cause significant economic hardship to many small tourism-based businesses. This would harm the may small communities that make up the region.

Sensitive ecosystems would be disrupted by the requisite utility infrastructure required by a development of this scale.  Even the reservoirs themselves would have little ecological benefit since the water levels constantly change.

In summary, this is not the right place for this proposal, and I urge you to deny the permit.
