Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

Article XIV of the NYS Constitution clearly states that the lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

This letter should begin and end with this simple, clear and binding promise. And yet the value of a promise is really only determined during periods of temptation, and this is one of those times we need to hold fast in the face of pressure from those who offer jobs and energy in exchange for the right to break this contract.

Without a doubt, we must look for sources of sustainable energy. But why must that come at the cost of one of the few pristine ecosystems left in the country? Why displace people, disrupt waterways, threaten NYC drinking water, decimate thriving species and test the entire local ecosystem in order to take a single step forward renewable energy? Why spoil the very thing we are trying to preserve?

More than 120 years ago, some wise people decided that it was in our collective best interest to protect the forests and waterways of the Catskills. They proclaimed that these lands should remain "forever wild," a haven that would be unsullied by the stresses and pollutions of industry. Until now, that promise has been kept. Help ensure it remains so.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Brian Kunath
