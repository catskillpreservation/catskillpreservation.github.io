As a resident of Woodland Valley, I would like to make my strong opposition to the proposed hydro electric reservoir project known.  This is a historic, bucolic valley with sensitive wildlife, and an important tourism industry to the area and community. I have been in Woodland Valley and the Hamlet of Phoenicia for over 20 years. I have seen derelict buildings, plazas and struggling businesses, turn around and finally start to thrive and employe local residences. This has brought much needed income to the region and the Mom and Pop small businesses.  Along with these flourishing and successful businesses, there are Historic Inns, campgrounds and world renowned trout fishing that would all be devastated if not permanently destroyed. I am all for "green" energy, but not when the "energy" is destroying the "green" it claims to want to protect!  Sincerely David Ilku
