Premium Energy’s project threatens so much that is precious about the Catskills - from wildlife and ecosystems to the health of NYC’s water supply. It is a deeply flawed plan that must not move forward. It could also cause residents to lose their beloved homes - all for the sake of profit. The Catskills Forest Preserve MUST be preserved.
