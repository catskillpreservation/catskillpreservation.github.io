Hi folks,
As a Town of Olive resident, I am opposed to the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. 

My family has been through something like this before. It was my great grandpa, Henry Clay Elmendorf, who had his land taken by the original Ashokan Reservoir project, and he was paid pennies on the dollar. 

In the current proposal, it includes "taking" people's land. 

Another objection has to do with conservation of energy. You propose pumping massive amounts of water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation, then later releasing that water, running it though a generator so you can make energy.

Does that really make good energy sense? Seems it would be much better to devise a method whereby you could have continues power generation capability. Something more must be at stake here. I am fully aware of the problem of renewables and that they are unreliable. In fact I have deployed solar at my home. 

Why try to put a band aid on an idea, use energy inefficiently, and displace 
people from their homes, to pursue an unstated goal of renewable energy. 

This Ashokan Pumped Storage Project is a BAD idea, and as a resident in the area, I am strongly opposed.  

Respectfully yours,
Dan Elmendorf
