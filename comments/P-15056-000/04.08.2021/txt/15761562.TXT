The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The plan as proposed would have very negative impacts on the NYC's drinking water.
Also, other negative impacts are on the ecology of the Preserve, on the streams, on fishing, and boating and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 would be extremely disruptive.
There would be a loss of tourist dollars.
It is vitally important to future generations to preserve the State Preserve.
