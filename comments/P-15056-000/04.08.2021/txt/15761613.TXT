Re: Motion to Oppose Project #15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose: 

I am writing to express my opposition to Project #15056-000, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  My family has lived and owned property in the Woodland Valley for nearly 200 years.  We have enjoyed summers, winters, and all seasons in between in this beautiful valley.  This dam has many negative impacts on this unique and wonderful ecosystem, including but not limited to: unacceptable risks to NYC DEP's unfiltered drinking water caused by increased turbidity and sediment to the Ashokan Reservoir which meaningfully impact New York City’s water supply; unacceptable impacts to communities working to protect NYC DEP's water supply; negative impacts on the Catskills tourism economy; negative impacts to Esopus Creek's valuable recreational fishery; the loss of the Woodland Valley Stream and its recreational fishery; the carbon loss of the forest and soil of more than 200 acres for the reservoir and associated roads, dam and other infrastructure; and irreversible impacts to wildlife in the project zone.  

Our family, as well as all of those living in the valley, would be impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually, from the proposed project #15056.  

I urge FERC to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely, 


Clara Gillespie Ferraro
