Greetings---As a property owner in the Town of Olive, NY and a former investor and member of an Electric Co-op in the State of Vermont and an avid advocate of hydro electric power; I must express my serious opposition to this proposed plan.  After studying the details I am convinced that it would be a serious blight on the local environment and it would likely put a damper on tourism in our locale.  I see no benefit to the people of this area from this proposed project. PLEASE do not approve this proposal.
Respectfully-
Donald Kass
