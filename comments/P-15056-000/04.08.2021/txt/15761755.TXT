I am opposed to the current proposal.  It will significantly and permanently adversely impact the viewshed from several hiking trails.  The proposed road closures will eliminate access points to popular hiking trails and overburden other areas of the Forest Preserve.  Sensitive vegetation is proposed for clearing which will result in ecosystem fragmentation.There is an unacceptable potential to increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC drinking water.
