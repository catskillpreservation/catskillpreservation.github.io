Premium Energy must not be allowed to build a dam, reservoir, and power plant in the Catskill Forrest Preserve. While I understand the need for clean renewable power I believe that this project would do more harm than good. The watershed has significant historic and cultural value as one of the most important trout streams in the world. There is a significant wild rainbow trout run in the Esopus and the brown trout population in the upper Ashokan basin uses the Esopus as a spawning run as well.
The proposed 226-acre reservoir and associated 300+ foot tall dam would cause tremendous habitat destruction and alter the local wild scenery in one of the most celebrated outdoor regions of the State.
What makes the project such a bad fit for the area is the large flow fluctuations it will cause n the Ashokan reservoir and the proposed reservoir. They fact that the water levels will be rising and lowering rapidly and at ecologically random intervals will cause harm to the aquatic wildlife as well as the forrest wildlife attracted to the shorelines.
Imagine looking down on a 20â€™ wide, mud-bank rimmed reservoir from Slide Mountain. This would be enough to cause John Burroughs to roll in his grave.
Please, lets stop this terrible idea before it wastes any more time.
