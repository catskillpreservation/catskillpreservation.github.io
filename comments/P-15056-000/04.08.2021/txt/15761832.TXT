Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,
I would like to register my objection to the proposed construction of a dam on the Ashokan Reservoir.

I am a lifelong resident of NYS and my family and I have vacationed in the area of Woodland Valley since 1976. We enjoy the nature activities of hiking and swimming and pristine nature of the surroundings. My husband does fly fishing for trout in the Woodland Valley stream, and as I state below it is a critical habitat for many animals.

Following are my objections to this project:

• Environment and Water Supply:
The project site is inside of Catskill Forest Preserve, and would destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology, the Esopus is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding habitats, and the area is one of the premier birding areas of NY State. This project would muddy the waters in the Ashokan Reservoir, which by the way supplies NYC with a high percentage of drinking water.

• Tourism and Small Businesses:
I have witnessed the growth of tourism in this area over the years and many small businesses have prospered. This will be devastating to them. Many local people would be put out of work, thus it is a another negative impactment.

• Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that
already displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.

The Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County and I believe under the Constitution of New York it is protected and not to be sold or leased or exchanged by any corporation public or private corporations.

I urge you, as a responsible public official, to reject the Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
