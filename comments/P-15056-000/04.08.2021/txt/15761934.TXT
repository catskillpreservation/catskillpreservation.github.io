NYC drinking water must be preserved at all cost. To construct a new upper reservoir in the Town of Olive would be a horrible mistake. The project would be devastating to ecosystems in the Catskills preserves, to people whose houses would be acquired by eminent domain and major disruption in the Town of Olive and surrounding communities. Stop the deal!!
