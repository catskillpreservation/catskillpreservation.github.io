To Whom it May Concern, 
I am a resident of Chichester, NY (Ulster County).  I strongly oppose the granting of a Preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings, it is misleading and deficient.
I believe the Catskills Forest Preserve is not the right location of such a project given the significant impacts to the forest lands, streams and wildlife and the New York City water supply.  This proposal would be in violation of the New York State Constitution Article XIV.  The Article states these lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any management of the State Forest Preserve.  A constitutional amendment is required, one that is voted on twice by the NYS legislature and submitted to the public in a referendum.
Premium Energy claims it will build a closed loop system and this is false. when it is actually an open loop system, where an upper reservoir would be added an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source.  The environmental impact to aquatic and wildlife would be significant. 
As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program.  According the US Department of Energy's own Hydropower Vision report,  Areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development. 
 Given the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve, the misleading nature of Premium Energy's proposal and the US Department of Energy's Hydropower Vision report to avoid Status 1 land, are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.
Sincerely,
Leonard Lerner
