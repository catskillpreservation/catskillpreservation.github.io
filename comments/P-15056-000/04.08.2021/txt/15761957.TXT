This proposed project is NOT good for the Catskills.  It is truly an assault on the intended purpose of Catskill Park, which was set aside to remain a forever wild tract of land.  If a hydroelectric plant is needed in the Catskills, it should be built outside of designated preserves.  Otherwise, what is the point of calling something a preserve??  What are we 'preserving' if we allow such a project to proceed, knowing it threatens the ecology of the park, the recreational access to trails, and the drinking water supply of NYC?  Let me repeat that last part.  This project threatens the drinking water of millions upon millions of people living in our country's most populous city.  Permission for this project needs to be denied.
