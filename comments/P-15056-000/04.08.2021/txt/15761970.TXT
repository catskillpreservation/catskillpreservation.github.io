Basis for Intervening:
I am filing a motion to be an intervener and I meet the requirements of 18CFR 385.214 of the Commission's regulation to be granted full party status.

My home is within the Catskill Park and in fact lies directly in front of the proposed site of the upper reservoir and the proposed location of the high tension wires required for the project. Therefore I am filing under the threat of EMINENT DOMAIN. 

Further, if my home were not taken by eminent domain, the project would ravage the area and cause loss of property value. I would also be living with the fear of damn failure and flooding to my home. 

I, Barbara Runz, respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Respectfully,
Barbara Runz
