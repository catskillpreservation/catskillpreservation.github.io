I urge that this project be rejected because

1. The proposed site is on designated Status 1 land, and federal policy explicitly directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development. This proposal would demand a Constitutional Amendment passed by the NYS Legislature and signed by the Governor. This barrier alone is sufficient to stop the proposal, in its tracks, at this very moment.

2.The proposed project will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for 9 million New York residents.

3. The flawed application misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.

4.The project raises numerous legal issues regarding States’ rights and land reservation.

5. The proposed site is home to protected species of wildlife and flora/fauna, as well as historical and cultural artifacts and sites.
