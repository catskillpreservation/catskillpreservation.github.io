Thanks for offering the opportunity to register my concern about this project. As a homeowner, business owner, mother and neighbor in West Shokan, NY I know we can do better than this flawed proposal puts forward. This Premium Energy plan would ruin my house and my business which are on the banks of the Bushkill River. We run the only cafe and market (Marty’s ‘Mercantile) serving our hamlet. This plan is bad for tourism (we were just written up in Hudson Valley Magazine!) 

Ulster county makes up 43% of NY state’s tourism income and the adverse impact of this project would greatly diminish the stream ecology which would also kill the trout and limit fly fishing tourists. My personal home, my three kids’ welfare and our community are also on my mind. 

Please consider the pump in a location near the aero rater where less personal and professional harm could be done to our community.

Thanks,
Sarah
