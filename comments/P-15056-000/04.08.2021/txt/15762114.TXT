To whom it may concern:

I am writing in strong opposition to Premium Energy's proposal to build a hydroelectric dam in the Catskills.   The impacts of such a construction project would be devastating to the wildlife, water supply, and people's homes and businesses.  This project does not have the consent of the communities it will impact the most, let alone the people in NYC who drink the water from the current reservoir.  

While I am not a resident of this area, I have family that has lived on Woodland Valley road since 1977.  I spent the winters and summers of my youth there tubing on the Esopus, hiking Giant's Ledge, and camping in Woodland Valley State Park.  Now I bring my own children there to take enjoy this beautiful section of New York. To lose these natural resources and rob people of these experiences would be an unforgivable crime.   

Do not allow this project to move forward.  

Sincerely,
Dan Taylor
