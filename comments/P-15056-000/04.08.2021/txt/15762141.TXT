This land was designated many years ago as “Forever Wild”, as it should remain for generations to come. There is no excuse for the proposed compromise beyond the selfish exploitation of protected resources. These types of actions can not be undone and will certainly prove destructive if not disastrous, and directly impact the beauty of our beloved Catskill region. 

Like the myriad of other locals commenting here, this is not a delusional attempt to halt the progress of energy and expansion within our home territory. However, the time is now to discuss ways in which advances can be made, yet not at the expense of diminishing natural resources.
