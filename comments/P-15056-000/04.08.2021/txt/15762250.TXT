Dear Ms. Bose

I am Elizabeth Riklin. I live at 10649 Montrose Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland and for the past 45 years, my family and I have been visiting Woodland Valley, Phoenicia.

I am writing to you to urge you to reject the deeply flawed proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York's Catskill Mountains.

I urge that the project be rejected because it would have a highly negative impact not only on the people, wildlife and organizations in Catskill region, but also the 9 million residents of New York City. The proposed project would severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir, the source of 40% of NYC drinking water, and surrounding streams. 

While I fully support efforts to develop  green-energy sources, this proposed effort would destroy protected wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife and contaminate local wells and septic systems, in addition to negatively impact the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers.  This is not a green-energy effort. 

I urge you, as a responsible public official, to reject the Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.    

Elizabeth S. Riklin
