Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to ask that FERC decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I am situated nearby and have been appraised of the negative impact this project will pose for the environment- and the drinking water of NYC.

Thanks for your time,

Ron Cohen
