I am a resident of Woodland Valley, Phoenicia NY.
I am completely disturbed by this proposal for a permit to be submitted or approved for Premium Energy Holdings,LLC. Have these people researched the area in question at all? Do they care about the natural resources at all?
At this time the project site is inside of Catskill Forest Preserve, and would destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885, and the NYS Constitution states that the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands, [and] shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The forests around the proposed sites rank among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, and are considered Status 2 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
Are you aware that at any time in this preserved area that a home owner needs to do repairs of any kind that involve the land, we have to get special permissions and approvals from The State agencies of DEC and DEP especially when it comes to septic systems. We cannot do anything without their watchful eye to make sure our ground waters are not contaminated. As homeowners we have come to expect excellence in protecting our natural surroundings. This has got to be addressed that a proposal and project of this magnitude will destroy our homes, our environments and natural surroundings. One can read any magazine these days and see that the Catskills are a tourist destination now. It is ever so popular and has remained that way all during the 2020 Pandemic. Do not let this California based company come and destroy our home! Let them do in in their own backyard... Not ours! Thank you
