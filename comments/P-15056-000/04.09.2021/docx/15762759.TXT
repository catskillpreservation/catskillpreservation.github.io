My name is Salomon Weir. I live in the hamlet of Chichester, Town of
Shandaken, Ulster County, in New York State. My FERC ID is #F648314.

I strongly oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy
Holdings (PEH) for the project to build a pumped storage hydroelectric
plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir (docket number P-15056).

I oppose it for the following reasons:

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest
      Preserve, which has been protected in the New York State
      Constitution since 1894.

2.  The proposed project would violate the designation of the Catskill
      Forest Preserve as Status 1 land by the Federal government, a
      protection which explicitly bars development

3.  The project would severely impact traffic on New York State Route
      214, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and
      counties.

4.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required.

5.  The topography of the land would make rerouting or replacing New
      York State Route 214 impossible,

6.  New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the
      city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance
      Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection
      Administration.

7.  As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

8.  With so much private property located within close proximity to the
      Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve,
      relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible
      without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

I urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny Premium Energy
Holdings the permit.
