The Premium proposal states that excess water from the proposed upper reservoir ( Woodland Valley) would be discharged to the Woodland Creek.  I am concerned  this 'excess of water' could tragically impact the area during a  flood. 

 Could you tell me the quantity of water that Premium intends to  discharge per hour?

There have been 11 major floods between 1933 and 2011.  I have lived in Phoenicia and witnessed the floods of 1980.1987,2005, 2010,2011.

In the spring of 1980 I was renting a house on the Esopus and watched as the water flowed over the nearby bridge.  When I returned to my house, water had filled 2 feet of the first floor.

In the fall of 2011, I was interested in buying a house on the Esopus.  During the flood a picture was taken. The house was enveloped in water with only the chimney sticking out.  Of course, the house was ruined and the property lost the backyard to the Esopus. 

I doesn't take much imagination to recognize that if a large body of water increases in size due to quick spring thaws, days of rain, hurricanes,etc, the discharge from the reservoir will add to the flooding problems of the already swollen tributaries.
