Hello,
I am writing today as a very concerned resident of New York State. The proposal to build a dam, reservoir and hydro electric power plant in the Catskills Forest Preserve is a dangerous and unwelcome project. It would effect the surrounding area and eco system of the Hudson Valley in a very scary way not to mention risk community displacement for folks living on private property near the proposed dam/plant. It would also directly effect the NYC water supply to over 9.5 million residents. As someone who has spent his whole life in the state of New York admiring its beauty and resilience I can’t help but feel I must speak up against any injustice that would be done to this state and it’s natural wonder. This proposal is dangerous and risky and should not be approved. I hope you hear our pleas and reject it. 
Thank you,
Maxwell Hegley
