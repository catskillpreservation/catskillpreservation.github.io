Dear Sir/Madam:

Please, please do not allow the permit for this Energy project to go forward. I strongly believe that this is not the right type of energy project to best serve this area and will have profound negative effects on the Catskill Preserve and the local neighborhoods, who lie in the path of these plans.

I urge you to deny this permit.

Sincerely,
Tom Efinger
