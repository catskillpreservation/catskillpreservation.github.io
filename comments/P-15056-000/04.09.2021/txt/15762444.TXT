Re:docketÂ P-15056

I strongly recommend that you do not approve this Permit.

I live in the town of Fleischmanns and frequently hike
in the areas where the upper level reservoirs are planned.

I am strongly in favor of renewable energy and recognize
that we will need to increase our ability to store excess
renewable power. I agree with the studies that have shown
that pumped storage facilities, like the one proposed, are
net energy consumers and can cause significant changes
to the environment and ecosystems in which they are sited.

For this reason, there must be a compelling reason to locate
a Pumped Storage facility in an environmentally sensitive region.

The proposed site is in a region that is:

Part of one of the largest State parks in NY.
Part of one of the best Trout fishing regions in NY state.
Part of the Drinking water system for NYC and other towns
Part of one of the best locations for outdoor activity (Hunting, Hiking, Skiing) in NY state.

I see no reason why this permit should be approved before the company
has shown that there are no sites where a Pumped storage facility
could be located that are less environmentally sensitive.

I recommend that you deny the permit
