Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am deeply disturbed by the proposal Premium Energy Holdings has made to build a hydroelectric power plant, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, in New York’s Catskill Mountains. This would be a devastating assault on the environment, on personal properties, on the exquisite way of life The Catskills offer, and on NYC drinking water. It is completely unacceptable I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the.
I’m certain you have received numerous science-based reports detailing the effects of a project like this one so I will not repeat what has been submitted. As a resident of the area I am disgusted by even the idea that a company would rape these beautiful Catskill Mountains, displace homeowners, and ignore the will of the people all for monetary gain.
We are at an important juncture in our life on this planet and if companies do not start making better, ecological and ethical decisions in how they conduct business this planet will not survive, and neither will my grandchildren.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
Sincerely,
Michael Goss
