     I am writing to you about a subject that concerns me deeply - Keeping NYS Forever Wild land truly forever wild.  A proposed hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Ashokan Reservoir would irreversibly damage areas of the Catskill Forest Preserve, threaten the experience of hikers and nature enthusiasts, endanger the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve and threaten the quality of New York City's water supply!
     Please do not green-light this terrible project!  Putting the profits of a private California Company ahead of the safety of the water supply of the nation's largest Metropolitan Region is not only an indefensible, unpopular policy, it is clearly contrary to the public good and could be fairly characterized as bordering on depraved indifference to the safety of the drinking water for millions of U.S. citizens!!!
