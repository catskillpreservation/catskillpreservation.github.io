  I believe that the Ashokan Pump Storage Project is a bad idea.  The Catksills are a state preserve protected by the NYS Constitution.  Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution the lands "shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation public or private."  The pump storage project would violate this article.            

This project would flood bird and wildlife habitats.  The rapid fluctuation of water will destroy aquatic and land habitats.  Trout breeding habitats, for example, will be lost.

This project will negatively impact tourism which is an integral part of our economy.  Tourism is a $1.6 BILLION dollar industry which provides almost 20,000 jobs.  Ulster County represents 43% of that market.

In addition to the above, over 100 years ago our valleys were flooded.  Businesses were destroyed, homes and farms were destroyed, families were torn apart, and numerous towns disappeared from the face of the earth.  The history of our area was erased.  Now, they want to do it again.  It is time for the rape of the Catskills to stop
