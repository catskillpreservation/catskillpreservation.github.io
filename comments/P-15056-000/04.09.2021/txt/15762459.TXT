Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
As a taxpayer, Architect and environmentalist I strongly oppose a project that remains unclear in terms of its intent and any transparency about long term benefits relative to near term disturbance to natural landscapes.
The project at best is confusing and unclear in intent.  I welcome dialogue about compromise and cost/benefit considerations, but not at the expense of clarity about intent, full disclosure and acknowledgement of the environmental sacrifice.  On the basis of how the project was introduced to the public alone, I reject it and its sponsors for the carelessness of its introduction.  If this is any indication, I fear for the worst in the execution and administration of the project.
thank you
