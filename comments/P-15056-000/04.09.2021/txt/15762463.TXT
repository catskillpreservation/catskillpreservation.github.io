Re:  Premium Energy California Corporation plan to flood and create a water storage dam in Woodland Valley Phoenicia NY 12464

Folks:

As a long time 20+ year resident of Woodland Valley and the owner of two homes there...one for our grand children and the other for our children...we register our strong objections to this proposal.  Our family has had a presence in the Catskills for over a century.

This Company...apparently unfamiliar with and unknown to our local community...is hunting for a site and has proposed several I believe.  I also think they are merely on a "fishing expedition" to locate the "least objectionable" site with the least objections locally...which seems a very unsound and unscientific way to do things.

Woodland Valley is a pristine part of the larger Catskill Preserve and NYC/NYS Watershed areas.  As such it provides much needed and valued recreational opportunities such as camping.fishing, swimming, tubing, hiking, biking and simply communing with nature and meditating.

The negative impact on people...some of whom will lose their homes, lose access to historic and recreational sites, see the water table and stream systems altered and destroyed...will only be matched by the negative impact on the abundant wildlife, which includes bears, turkeys, deer, rabbits, ducks, trout, bass and countless others.

We humbly beg that you not allow this to happen!

Thanks,
Erwin A. Silverstein and family..all prud residents of the great state of New York and the United States of America
