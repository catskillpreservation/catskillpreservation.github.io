We are quite concern about how this project will impact our small hamlet of Hurley and surrounding towns. Wires from utility lines will cross our property after we spent our own money to bury our own utility wires years ago. The number of wires crossing land belonging to many neighbors will impact land values. The impact on our water supplies and the natural beauty of our area will be impacted forever. It is time to explore more solar options rather than ruin the water and beauty of our Catskills. Leave the beauty and water safe for future generations!
