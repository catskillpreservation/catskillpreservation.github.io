Premium Energy has submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that seeks permission to do a feasibility study that would clarify the project’s scope and viability. This is an inappropriate project that threatens the environmental and economic viability of our region. 

The project’s proximity to the Catskills is of great concern, as the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The project would also increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water. I’m also worried that the project would displace residents. My understanding is that the Ashokan watershed agreement limits development to keep the watershed safe. This has shaped the character of our region. It’s incomprehensible that a project on such a scale would even be possible, given the need to protect the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers. 

Please do not allow Premium Energy to move forward with this plan. 

Sincerely,
