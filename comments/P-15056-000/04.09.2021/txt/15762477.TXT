To whom it may concern, 

As a resident of West Shokan and New York City, I am extremely troubled by FERC’s proposal. In addition to our home in the town of Olive, we have two long-term residents who would be displaced by the proposal in a community that is already experiencing a housing shortage. Not to mention the disruption to the economy and local tourism that such a project would cause.  Even more concerningly is the long-term negative impact it would have on the ecosystem, aquatic and land habitats, and certain loss of habitat for innumerable species. Disruption to the water supply feeding the Ashokan reservoir would also impact a critical drinking water supply for both local residents (well water) and for New York City. 

The  Catskills are a State Preserve and protected by the NY State Constitution. Under Article XIV of the NYS ConsItuIon, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Furthermore, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protectIons designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

This plan is seriously flawed, does not appear to be well thought out, and should not be allowed to move forward.
