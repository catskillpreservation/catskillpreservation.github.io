It has come to my attention that Premium Energy Holdings LLC has applied for permission to construct a dam, reservoir, pipeline, powerhouse and high voltage electrical lines in my beloved and pristine Stoney Clove Valley. The Lanesville home that I have lived in for the past 50 years is right smack in the middle of this proposed site. Has this so called company heard that the area we live in has been designated as a forever wild Forest Preserve?

Would you allow them to destroy an ancient ecosystem, where native brook trout, whitetail deer, black bear, bobcat, fox, eagles, hawks and yes even blue heron's call home. As a senior citizen who loves the outdoors do I want access to my favorite, local, hiking trails eliminated. To this I answer with a resounding NO!

Our beloved scenic byway Route 214 is our only access to our recreational ski mountains, hiking trails and favorite fishing spots along the pure waters of the Stoney Clove Creek. You would allow them to destroy all of this in the name of supposedly renewable energy. That makes no sense to me at all. Let's ruin something thats good and beautiful to satisfy some ludicrous political agenda.

Please be warned that we fought and won to outlaw fracking in our Forest Preserve  and we will fight and win in shutting down this ridiculous idea also. I am willing to spend whatever it takes to pay for lawyers and support grass roots community activists, who will fight with us, to end this abuse of power.

Thank you for this platform to convey my unyielding opposition to this proposal.
