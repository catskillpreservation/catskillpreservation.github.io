Hello -

I must protest this project.  I used to be an Environmental Chemist for Westchester County and am now a staunch environmentalist.  We found serious problems with sediment in reservoir water, and that is without even involving a major construction project as this one.  I cannot believe this is environmentally sound, and the consequences are difficult to predict.  New York State has other sources of energy much less intrusive than this project.  Thank you.
