To whom it may concern,
I am a resident of Woodland Valley in Phoenicia New York, and have recently become aware of the outlandish proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings. While I am a firm believer in- and proponent of- clean energy alternatives, I am vehemently opposed to the aformentioned project on more levels than I can even begin to express in the space allotted.

After studying the proposal in great detail, it seems obvious that its completion would have a profound negative effect on the precious Catskill preserve- a unique and sacred area that is singular and cherished by so many. Its effect on the Eusopus and its tributaries alone make it unthinkable to anyone who delights in the pristine streams that make up this area. 
It would negatively impact the New York City water supply and undoubtedly have a delirious effect on local tourism-which is vital to the livelihoods of so many residents.
I could go on and on with technical objections to the project—but why point out what you clearly already know?

On a personal level- I am neighbors with a family living in a home that was moved from the Ashokan reservoir nearly a century ago. They have personally recounted to me on several occasions the emotional impact and trauma that their family, and so many others, experienced when their homes were destroyed and their lives uprooted. It’s unthinkable to imagine something like that happening in our backyard today.

I know I speak for nearly all of my neighbors- many of whom may have no doubt already voiced their objections-when I say that this is a highly unpopular proposal of which virtually no resident is in favor.

We sincerely hope you will put an end to it in its early stages.

Thank you
Eugene Ruffolo
