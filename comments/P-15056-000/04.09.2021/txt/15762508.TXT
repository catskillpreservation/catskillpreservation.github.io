Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Washington, D.C. 20426.
Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I oppose the misguided proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant—the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056—in New York’s Catskill Mountains.  this project would ruin the environment and disrupt many local communities.  It also poses a serious risk to the safety and purity of New York City’s drinking water.   I urge you to deny their request for a preliminary permit.
Although I live in New Mexico, I and millions of other tourists around the country travel to the Catskills area to enjoy the very beauty and calm that this ill-conceived project threatens.  Please do not allow it to proceed.
Sincerely,
Howard J. Fisher
Santa Fe, New Mexico
