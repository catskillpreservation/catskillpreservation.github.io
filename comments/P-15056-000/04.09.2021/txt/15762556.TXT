Basis for Intervening:
I am a land owner on the site of the proposed project and as a former hydro supervisor for Central Hudson gas and electric., who was in charge of Four FERC regulated run of the river and pond storage hydro facilities.n
  I wish to have all information regarding the pumped storage proposal including site updates , any proposed plans and filings that are submitted by all parties to FERC. 
   I am opposed to this project on many levels not just as a land owner and land access and loss issues but also preservation of the Catskills park and the surrounding areas.
