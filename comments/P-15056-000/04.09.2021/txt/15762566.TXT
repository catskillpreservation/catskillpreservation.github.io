As a resident of New York City, which is using the Ashokan Reservoir as a source of water, I am concerned about using that water for other purposes. In particular, I am concerned about the possibility of introducing invasive species that can affect the water or the distribution system. By effectively extending the reservoir, especially into an area not controlled by the NYC DEP, additional opportunities for invasive species to enter the water are created.
