I think this proposed hydro electric plant is crazy.  It's right in the middle of a watershed for New York City.  There is no way to guarantee the safety of the water with a project like this in the drainage basin.  Plus, this project is in the Catskill Park, which is comprised of a lot of forever wild land.  FOREVER WILD.  That still means something. Doesn't it?  Our area is seeing a boom in eco tourism. This is hiking, camping, biking, fishing, and many other outdoor activities that are dependent on the wilderness.  Remaining wild.  Please deny this application. It does't suit the intended use of this area.  Thank you.
