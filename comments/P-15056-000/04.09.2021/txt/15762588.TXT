I am frankly appalled at this proposal. The plan is completely reckless and is totally without regard to the local environmental system. The word preposterous comes to mind.

Here are just a few things that would change for the worse:
1: Hiking up to Friday and Balsam Cap Mountains would be eliminated thanks to the flooding of Moonhaw Road. 
2: The area is a spawning area of trout fisheries. Something Shandaken is well-known for.
3: The construction will disturb one of the most pristine views in the Catskills with added power lines, not to mention that the construction process itself will be invasive, loud, dirty, and inconvenient to residents in the area.
4: The proposed sites in the the area are Status 1 Land. The DOE has said that Status 1 and 2 land must be avoided for development. The Catskill Park can not be developed on without an amendment to the state constitution which protects the park specifically.
5: This project is likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, and it will cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.
