Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

Under no circumstances should the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceed with its application for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. The impact of this project on the community and environment would be unethical and illegal.

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area. According to the National Audubon Society, the Ashokan site has supported a nesting pair of Bald Eagles for the past ten years and hosts up to six Bald Eagles during the winter. Our national bird, the symbol of justice and democracy, would be displaced. Hopefully, you can see the irony in this situation.

I am certain that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can find a more suitable place for a pumped storage project, one that would not disrupting the Ashokan Reservoir community to a devastating degree.

Thank You,

Lisa St. John
