Dear Secretary Bose, 

I write in opposition to the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal filed by Premium Energy Holdings LLC. This is a highly flawed proposal. The impact of this power plant, if implemented, will devastate the environment, wildlife, and recreation in the area, as well as, the local community and economy.

Most importantly, it threatens the water quality and supply for New York City.

It is difficult to understand the benefits of this plan in relation to all the harm it will cause. The plan does not address an identified energy deficit. While hydroelectric power can be a green energy solution in some scenarios, this is not one.

Please include these considerations in the evaluation of this proposal.

Thank you,

Julie Brewer
