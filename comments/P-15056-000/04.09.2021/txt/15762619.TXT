Hello,

I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal filed by Premium Energy Holdings LLC. This is a dangerous proposal. This power plant will devastate the environment, wildlife, and recreation in the area, and hurt the local community and economy.

Plus it will threaten the water quality and supply for New York City.

While I am all for clean renewable energy, this hydroelectric plant will destroy a priceless area of New York's famed Catskills.

I encourage you to consider the detailed information provided by the Coalition to Save the Catskills Preserve http://savecatskillspreserve.org during your evaluation of this proposal, and reject the proposal.

Thank you,
