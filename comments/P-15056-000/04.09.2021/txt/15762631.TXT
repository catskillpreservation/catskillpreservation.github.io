It would be environmental devastation and a threat to our water supply to allow the proposed power station by Premium Energy to be allowed to happen. It is an unnecessary project that seems to be more interested in making a profit at the cost of the people that would be affected adversely. There is much natural beauty and wildlife in our beautiful region. This project should not be allowed to happen.  Linda Boyer, Kingston, NY
