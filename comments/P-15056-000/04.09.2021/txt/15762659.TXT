Building a new hydro-electric dam in the Catskills, in a protected wild area is not congruent with the law nor the needs of the future. Although we need clean energy to combat climate change, destroying protected wild areas and reservoirs that supply clean water to NYC is not the way to do it. This ill thought out and destructive project should be immediately dismissed.
