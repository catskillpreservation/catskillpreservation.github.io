I am vehemently opposed to Premium Energy Holdings proposal of a pumped storage system at the Ashokan resevoir p-15056. 

I moved to West Shokan 20 years ago because the pristine 700,000 acres in the Catskill Preserve is to be left wild and untouched. The protected Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program” created in 1885. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

As well as the transmission lines going right through our property,I have a business that would also directly be affected. Tourism is a big part of our economy.
Premium Energys proposal would be a complete devastation to our eco system, community,wildlife,streams and the millions that come to hike,bike,eat,visit our shops and take in the natural beauty every year.

None of the 3 locations proposed are right for this enormous, intrusive project.


Premium Energy is saying this is to be "closed-looped". It is not ,it is an "add on" and would likely increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed.The redirection of water would likely impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.

NYC has been famous for their drinking water because it comes from here! 
One little likely mishap could threaten the drinking water of nine million plus.

I urge FERC not to grant this preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings.

Thank you,Terri
