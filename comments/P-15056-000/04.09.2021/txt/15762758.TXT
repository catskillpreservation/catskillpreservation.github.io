Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I feel that it is a deeply problematic proposal and I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. It’s clear that the project would have a devastating to the natural setting, to the community that lives there, and to New York’s drinking water supply.

The Preserve contains hundreds of thousands of acres of continuous wildlife habitat. I have visited this area often, and it’s a welcome respite for New York City denizens like myself. It would be a travesty to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land. In a time when natural landscapes like the Catskill Mountains are increasingly a luxury commodity, it would set an awful precedent for protected lands across the country—not to mention in New York State, a place that prides itself on its natural environs.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Alex Teplitzky
