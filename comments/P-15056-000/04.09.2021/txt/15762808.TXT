To whom it may concern,

I stand with Senator Michelle Hinchey and the Catskill Center in opposition to Premium Energy Holdings proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As a citizen living in close proximity to the reservoir I am against the construction and infrastructure required in the proposal. I greatly enjoy the scenic landscape and the life that abounds in and around the Ashokan and do not want increased traffic, noise, pollution and potential problems that come with a large scale project like this. As a fisherman I oppose the project for the impact it will have on the wildlife and water quality for years to come. Please reject this proposal.
