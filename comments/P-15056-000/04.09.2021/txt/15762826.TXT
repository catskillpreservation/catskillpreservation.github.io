Re: docket number P-15056-000, the proposed Premium Energy hydroelectric plant on the upper end of the Ashokan Reservoir.

This project would be detrimental in so many ways that I can hardly believe it is even being considered. For starters, the Askokan is an open system, meaning that the turbidity created by the daily release of water would impact both New York Cityâ€™s drinking water quality, but also be the death knell for aquatic life in the already heavily-impacted Esopus Creek. 

Construction of a system of this scale would damage pristine and near-pristine natural areas in a place famous for its beauty and its healthy ecosystem. The creation of water basins would disrupt fish spawning, and bird and animal habitat. Human beings live in these areas, too. It is unthinkable that homes in families for generations could be razed, or their value reduced, by the intrusion of this massive project.

This proposal will benefit no one in the immediate area. The benefit to the power reserve in general is far outweighed by the negative impact it would have on local communities and natural habitats.
