The “Premium Energy” plan for a new hydro electric system is a terrible idea. 

Frankly, I don’t see anything beneficial in this plan, but I do see damage to an area known for its beauty, its sports, and its wildlife.

I understand this has been tried before in “closed systems” (not affecting places where people actually live). But they’re talking about disturbing some of the most beautiful countryside in the Sate. Taking away land, places where people live, fish, hike -- affecting tourism, and the various reasons why people live in and visit the area. Furthermore, the quality of the water reaching New York City is bound to be adversely affected as more water churns up the Ashokan Reservoir.

With no guarantees that residents would see any real financial benefit. To me, a New York City resident who bought property in the area 30 years ago and pays taxes, I see a lose/lose situation.

A hundred years ago, the Ashokan Reservoir uprooted thousands of people, and the water which flowed to New York City came at the cost of towns, communities, and local history. That’s done, and the result is a delicate balance of beauty and infrastructure. Please, please, please, don’t mess with what we already have.
