Hello,
I am a homeowner and business owner in Boiceville, NY for the last 7 years. It will be a detriment to our community to have this Pumped Storage Project approved. Not only will it reduce home values in our area but will have an enormous impact on those who live around the area where the project will be located.
I am a realtor with an office in Boiceville, NY. The area in which I conduct most of my business is Olive, West Shokan, Woodland Valley, West Hurley, and Mt Tremper. It will seriously affect home prices! It will sway people from buying in the area where the proposed powerhouse will be. It will be a blight on the land where the proposed reservoir will be. The flora and fauna will suffer and there will be a terrible consequence to pay for lost habitat.
Let me make myself perfectly clear, I am deeply opposed to this project and will do all that I must to prevent this from happening.
Sincerely,
Francesca Ortolano
Boiceville, NY 12412
