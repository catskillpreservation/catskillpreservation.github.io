The proposed hydroelectric plant is a threat the the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the Catskills system for the NYC area, supplies up to 40% of the cityâ€™s daily needs. The reservoirs was carefully constructed, considering the local ecosystems and habitats to ensure safe drinking water. The hydroelectric plant could greatly damage this system in various ways. The powerlines will fragment habitats and ecosystems and disrupt the environment. It also would be disastrous for the tourist economy that exists as one of the few sources of support for the region. A hydroelectric plant would do more harm than good!
