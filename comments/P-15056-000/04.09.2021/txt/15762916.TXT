As a lifelong resident of Ulster County and passionate Catskills region advocate, I am submitting here my grievance with Premium Energy Holdings of California and the attempts to build a hydroelectric power plant underground. The drive to use green energy must continue, but not in a manner which contradicts the ultimate purpose to preserve nature. Once is enough! This project must not be allowed to begin nor continue any types of negotiations on the matter.
