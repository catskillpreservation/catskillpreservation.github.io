I am writing in response to the outrageous proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a plant in the Catskills. I strongly urge FERC to deny their request for permit for a number of reasons. If this project is allowed to proceed, it would be devastating to the environment, displace people from their homes, disrupt the local community, and risk the purity of NYC water. While these types of plants are necessary to move us towards more renewable energy, the Catskills are not the place to do this. This land is meant to remain protected. The pumped storage will wreak havoc on the local ecology. In addition to environmental impacts, the community would be ripped apart, displacing people from their homes in order to seize the land. There is already a housing shortage as more and more people are leaving city areas to move to upstate communities. These people will have no where to go if displaced from their homes. The local economy thrives partly on tourism due to the beautiful hiking and outdoor recreational opportunities it has to offer. This would also be severely damaged if this project proceeds, which would in turn have a large impact on local businesses. The impacts of this trickle down to all aspects of life in this community. Please consider this and put an end to this project. Save our community!
