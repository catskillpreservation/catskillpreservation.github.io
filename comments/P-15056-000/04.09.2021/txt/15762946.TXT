I am writing to voice my strong objection to the Ashokan Hydroelectric Storage Facility proposed by Premium Energy Holdings of California. The impact on the natural environment and our beautiful wilderness, as well as on the people of the Catskills Mountains will be egregious. Please say NO. Lucy Childs, Big Indian, New York
