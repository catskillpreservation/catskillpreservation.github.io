Hey there. I’ve fallen in love with the Hudson Valley over the last 9 years with my wife. Ever since our first trip there to celebrate our engagement, we’ve been returning multiple times a year, including for our wedding. Additionally, we’ve used the beautiful region for our film projects as actor-filmmakers, and the idea of that land being infringed upon truly hurts. Please don’t let this company destroy what is already good.

Yours,

Clay von Carlowitz
