I am 81 years old , lived in Olive since 1981 and just canâ€™t fathom leaving my home which is in the center of this proposal. It would put my home 50 feet under water. The only way I plan on leaving is dead in a pine box.

Our area would be impacted with high tension wires, compromised wells, disruption of businesses, lives , tourism, and flood plain risks for those near the project. The water quality feeding the reservoir which feeds NYC will be disturbed. If water temperatures are warmer bacteria grows. Like Texas this past winter, their system was damaged resulting in loss of power for days in freezing temperatures. 
The only thing green about this for profit project is the green in the pockets of the outfit proposing the underground hydroelectric project.

Please do not let this happen. We lost a whole town when the reservoir was built. We do not such development again.

Respectfully,
Sandra Friedel property owner here in Olive.
