Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am a fulltime resident of Olive, NY and I am deeply concerned and opposed to the woefully flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains, my home. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the treasured environment, highly disruptive to me, my neighbors, and other local communities, as well as presenting a significant risk to the quality NYC’s drinking water.

I am well aware of the need for additional sources of energy to meet the increasing demands of our society. This proposal is not the way to do it, not by any means. The environmental devastation, social disruption, and host of other negatives far outweigh the benefits this hydroelectric power plant would provide.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Nathan
Olive, NY
