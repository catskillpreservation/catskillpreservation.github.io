This proposal is a slap in the face that we cannot stand for. A California company with no concept of the unique infrastructure and glorious environment of the Hudson Valley has made it their mission to contaminate our waters and decimate our ecological systems. This is a blasphemous catastrophe under the guise of environmentalism.
The Hudson Valley land is our home and this water is our life- the proposal aims to strip our community of a safe and healthy future. To even consider this is a betrayal.
