I am in support of this concept, however there are some concerns with this project. The need for this type of project is important to support the development of renewable energy generation. As a Certified Energy Manager I am have a good understand of the energy needs of this state and country and the efficient utilization of energy.  Pumped storage is a proven technology and once constructed is environmentally friendly. 
As a frequent visitor to state public lands, my major concern of this project is the impact on public lands. The Catskill Park is protected by the State Constitution to be forever wild.  Additionally this land is open for all visitors to enjoy.  Any pumped storage project must maintain this public access to state lands.  While some people feel flooding of this land by such a project violates the State Constitution, I see it as a benefit as long as the newly created lake becomes publicly accessible both that on current public land and that land purchased for this project for the purpose of creating the upper reservoir. Additionally, any new infrastructure (Dams, Intakes, Pumps, pipelines and transmission lines, etc.) must be located on land that is not currently protected state land.  If any state land is required it must be replaced with a greater amount and value of land being used for this project. Such a land swap must be achieved through a statewide ballot refrendum to amend the State Constitution.
