Dear Ms. Bose,
I’m writing to OPPOSE the Proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant, FERC project number, P-15056.
I agree we should be finding new and better ways to use renewable energy and a storage plant does sound useful, the Catskill Mountains are not feasible for several reasons. It will hurt the tourism economy, displace people who won’t be able to afford or find housing in the area, be devastating to the environment and risky for the purity of NYC ‘s drinking water.

*Being retired we’ve traveled to the Catskills’area four to five times a year from our home in Wisconsin for more than ten years, spending our only tourism dollars at Orchards, Restaurants, Stores and Parks, Vacation Rentals and Hotels. New York’s Economy depends on visitors, with 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019 bringing in 1.6 billion dollars and supporting 20,000 jobs. 43% of that market being Ulster County. Second Homes generate $360 million in economic activity. (Source: Tourism Economics, “Economic Impact of Tourism in NY”, 2019.) 
Whichever proposed area you use would have a negative impact on the tourism of the area, due to the construction, lane closures, etc. I can’t imagine miles of cement trucks and construction vehicles even driving on the twisty roads through the forest, bumper to bumper up and down the narrow roads in the area. 
*With the real estate values almost double in the last three years in the Catskills area and New York City workers realizing this two-hour drive from their corporate offices provides the perfect placement of their work from home offices, this trend will continue, unless of course, they must relocate their homes and business with this plan. Displaced families may very likely find that they can no longer afford the area.
Since the beginning of time the Catskills have been home to people who care for and about this land. Walking the trails in the parks you feel the presence of the Esopus Tribe of Native Americans and know that you are seeing the land as they saw it. Upstate New Yorkers, and visitors are privileged to have this place to be in nature and with nature close to how it once was and they respect it, and it is to be RESPECTED by all.
*This must be what inspired them to, in 1885 create The Catskills Forest Preserve and later to PROTECT it. It enchants visitors and residents with 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region wide according to New York State Forest Condition Index. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 Land under USGS” Gap Analysis Project”. According to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under USGS Gap Analysis Program are AVOIDED for development”.
*Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

*According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line - Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then summited to the public in a referendum. 

One reason for all of this is to protect the land, wildlife, the birds, which fall within Audubon’s Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area, and the trout waters in the Esopus River. The trout breeding habitat would be lost if this proposed project goes through. Not to mention the historical buildings that may be lost in the area.

* A pumped storage upper reservoir will be subject to rapid fluctuations of water which will severely damage both land and aquatic habitats. The sediment regime will be altered in tributaries to the Esopus River and also the NYC water supply!

*Forty per cent of NYC’s water supply, provides 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people that will be impacted, according to the DEP.  When the Ashokan Reservoir was built 25 communities were displaced and billions of dollars were invested, $1.7 billion since 1990’s alone. It’s currently the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation and it currently meets the needs of NYC but it must be protected. Climate change evaporation, heat events, and decreasing snowpack already produce uncertainty and adding a storage plant will produce turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir that will greatly affect its water quality.

*And lastly, the Department of Energy prefers closed-loop projects that have smaller environmental impact and may be eligible for streamlined FERC approval, but adding to the existing lower Ashokan Reservoir/Watershed will be an add-on project, not a closed-loop project. 
By Premium Energy lying in their application, to the public and FERC, with their sole purpose of being fast tracked for approval, they are telling us they cannot be trusted in anything they promise to do. 

Transitioning to renewable, green-energy sources must not devastate this pristine environment! 
One hundred years ago, 25 communities were affected by the building of the Ashokan Reservoir and people are still not over it. If you must affect the lives of several more communities for generations, choose an area that is not as beautiful and cherished by so many. And at least do not re-traumatize the same people!
PE should follow the Department of Energy’s Hydropower plan, and the NYS Constitution and don’t create mistrust by lying.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
