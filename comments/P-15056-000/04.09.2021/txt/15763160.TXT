Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose

We are submitting these comments on behalf of the Coalition to Save Catskill Preserve.

The Coalition is a newly formed grass-roots network composed of a growing number of residents and community groups of the Catskill Region of New York State and their allies.  In our dedication to protecting the environment, wildlife, recreation, cultural heritage and local communities, we are expressing profoundly serious concerns with the deeply flawed proposal submitted to FERC by Premium Energy Holdings to construct a hydroelectric plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains
  
The Coalition now consists of more than 200 members from the region and 20 organizations and is growing daily. Coalition members live both in and out of the region and are dedicated to protecting the ecology and history of the Catskill Preserve from misguided and inappropriate exploitation of this area, as exemplified by the Premium proposal.

This project must be rejected because it would disrupt the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve, 700,000 acres of critical habitat in an increasingly fragmented world. 

Any feasible site in the Catskills would impinge on USGS-designated Status 2 land. Federal policy directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development.



Furthermore
•	Implementation of this project would require a NYS Constitutional Amendment requiring passage of both Houses of New York State Legislature, a public vote, and a sign off by the Governor. 

•	It will flood over 200 acres of private land and protected state forests to construct a new reservoir

•	The new reservoir would be connected to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel up to 50 feet wide and many miles long, drilled under both public and private lands, and the erection of at least 12.9 miles of 230kV high-tension transmission lines.

•	The project will threaten endangered species, impact the NYC water supply, discourage tourism, and have a serious negative economic impact on the region

•	It will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for over 9 million New York residents. 

•	It will severely disrupt existing regional wells and septic systems which in turn will negatively affect the quality of water regionally and in New York City.  

•	Premium Energy misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.

•	The project would require the seizing of many private parcels via eminent domain, the devaluation of even more additional private parcels and the construction of a massive concrete dam up to 300 feet tall. 

•	The applicant, Premium Energy, has failed in its due diligence obligations. They have made numerous factual errors and omissions in both the original and amended application. They are clearly unqualified to design, construct or maintain a project of this scope.  

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, and negatively impact the drinking water of over 9 million New Yorkers.


The Coalition urges FERC, as responsible public officials, to reject the Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
