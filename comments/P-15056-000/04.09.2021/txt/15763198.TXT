The environmental destruction of protected lands and economic and social disruption from this project far outweigh the purported benefits. The project only benefits Premium Energy, while severely degrading the local area. It is uncertain whether or not it would actually lower energy costs.   

Commenters have been advised that FERC does not weigh harmful human and social damage of proposed projects, which is in itself appalling. However please consider that when the Ashokan Reservoir was constructed between 1907 and 1915,  the New York City Board of Water Supply impounded the Esopus Creek, submerging thousands of acres of farmland. The impoundment covered twelve communities located in a valley where farming, logging, and quarrying prevailed. Approximately two thousand residents along with roads, homes, shops, farms, churches, and mills were either moved or abandoned, but most of them were torn down. Substantial bitterness remains among the residents of these towns whose families and ancestors were so cavalierly dislocated. 

The massive statutory and procedural barriers to implementation of this project indicate protracted, expensive legal proceedings for Premium Energy and it's legions of opponents. 

Please reject this outrageous application to destroy natural areas for corporate profit.
