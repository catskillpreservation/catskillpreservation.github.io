The Catskills are a special place; one that I have frequented with family and friends for years. The natural environment is an incredible resource, as is the gateway communities that provide access to it. This proposal, for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Plan, seems to take all of that for granted.

That it has been filed without input by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation or the New York City Department of Environmental Protection is unsurprising as the impact of the construction of new dams, power lines, and tunnels on the local communities and critical wildlife habitat seems totally unconsidered.

That is has been summarily opposed by local government and the region's outdoor community is less surprising. The impacts on tourism and recreation—of incredible importance to the Catskills in all seasons—are potentially devastating. 

I'm writing in total opposition to this plan and ask that it rejected immediately.
