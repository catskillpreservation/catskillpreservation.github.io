[PREFACE: According to an article in the Kingston Daily Freeman, Premium Energy Holdings is going to withdraw their current proposal and submit a new proposal seeking evaluation of a different upper reservoir site in an unknown location. However, I remain vehemently against any hydroelectric project in the Catskills Forest Preserve, especially involving the Ashokan Reservoir for reasons following.]
===========================================

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in regard to Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant in at the Ashokan Reservoir, docket P-15056. I am a resident of Phoenicia, NY and I am strongly opposed to the proposal. 

The proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings states that this is a closed-loop system, when clearly it is not: the proposal is to add a new reservoir built at one of three possible sites to connect to the Ashokan Reservoir, the largest source of unfiltered water in the nation and supplier of 40% of New York City’s water needs. This haphazard and deceptive description of the project by the California-based company should be enough to disqualify them from undertaking such a project where they have no interest other than profit. 

The nature of this type of project would be permanently devastating to the environment and wildlife, and therefore the livelihood of the local economy, which depends so much on the tourism that the beauty of this area attracts. 

The rapidly fluctuating water levels would destroy the natural habitats of so many vital and endangered species, including trout, turtles, bald eagle and many others. It would greatly increase turbidity of the tributaries of the Ashokan Reservoir, jeopardizing water quality for millions of New York City residents. Not addressed in the proposal is investigating the effects of such a project on the local groundwater table that supplies water to most of the area’s residents and businesses. 

Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the Catskills Forest Preserve, created in 1885, “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, and then submitted to the public in a referendum. The effort to push this project through will be a long and costly process that should ultimately fail. This is not just a local concern, and will bring widespread opposition. 

I understand the vital benefit offered by pumped-storage hydroelectric plants to reduce the daily demand for fossil fuel-generated power, but for the reasons stated above (and stated by so many other concerned citizens) the Catskill region and New York City water supply are inappropriate for this type of project.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely yours,
Benjamin Jackson
