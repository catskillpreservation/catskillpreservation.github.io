My name is Jason Kurtz and I am a resident of West Shokan, NY.  I recently became aware of the proposal by Premium Energy entitled “Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.”  I was surprised by many aspects of this proposal because of the immense ramifications on so many levels. Simply put, Premium Energy does not deserve the special consideration FERC may give to closed-loop projects. For starters, these highly preserved state lands are kept so for important ecological reasons, most notably the important bird and fish wildlife habitats. This highly preserved land has been so since 1885, when the NYS Constitution declared this 700K acres of continuous wildlife habitat of Catskills forest be “forever kept as wild.” As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program – and the DEP has said land areas designated as Status 1 or 2 will be “avoided for development.” If this proposal did in fact get any traction, it would have to be passed by a constitutional amendment by the NYS Constitution, voted on by two consecutive sessions in state legislature and then submitted to the public for referendum. Is Premium Energy even aware they are proposing a project in such a protected environment? Also, please note, this proposal by Premium Energy is not factual. This proposal is NOT for a closed-loop project, it is an add-on project since an upper reservoir would be added on to a lower reservoir – so this proposal is, in fact, deficient and misleading. This proposed project cannot happen. Thank you.
