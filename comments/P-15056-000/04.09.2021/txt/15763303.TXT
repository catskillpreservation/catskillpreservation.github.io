I strongly object to the proposed Ashokan Pump Storage Project. 
There will be environmental degradation, there will be the possibility of accidents which could possibly affect hundreds of thousands of people.
This project is a grab,by an out of state company, for enormous profit at the expense of New Yorkers.
The 21 century is on the cutting edge of new energy producing technology. We don't need a variation on old school technology to foul our land. Be forward thinking.
This project will be fought tooth and nail and is dead on arrival.
