Docket P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose,
I am submitting the following as a resident of the town of Olive, NY which would suffer significant negative environmental impacts from the proposed project.

The following are a few of the omissions in the amended Application for Preliminary Permit proposal submitted 2/1/21:
18CFR § 4.32(a)(2)(i)(A): Greene County is not identified. (a)(2)(iii)(A) Greene County Soil and Conservation District is not identified.
4.81(b)(1) the proposal does not identify or describe the existing spillways and dividing weir at the Ashokan reservoir.
4.81(b)(6) the proposal fails to demonstrate how the proposed project would develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.

18 CFR § 4.32(j) states that “Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.” 
For this project to move forward it would require electrical transmission line studies and improvements external to the project that are yet to be done / completed. The Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) as it relates to the NYC watershed and water supply would need to be renegotiated with the USEPA before preliminary work on this project could proceed. An Amendment to the NY State Constitution would be required as well.  As all of these would occur in the future, and as the constitutional amendment and revised FAD are at the least extremely unlikely to occur, this proposal should be rejected.

Comments 
The project is an add on, open loop project, not closed loop despite being described as such, as the Esopus Creek runs into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir. The DOE has promoted closed rather than open loop projects.
The project as proposed would be powered primarily by non-renewable sources. This is counter to the intent of recent NYS Clean Energy legislation. 

Proposal Section 4: “The project would store excess renewable energy, helping to integrate renewables into the grid, and to supply firm peaking power generation with primary load following capability.”  

Renewables make up about 6% of NY Downstate region generation. NYISO seasonal load profiles show that peak demand is not concurrent with PV production, rather it occurs during evening hours when 94% of generation is from fossil fuels (69%) / nuclear power (25%). Likewise only 1.6% of upstate (not local) wind energy was curtailed (2019) due to capacity / transmission issues. Economics point to pumping during late night hours when demand is lowest, utilizing no PV generation and little if any wind generation.

Further, NYS utilities have argued before FERC that incentives for additional generation in the downstate region are unnecessary due to ongoing and planned transmission upgrades.

In consideration of the above and cited information, I request that you reject this Application for a Preliminary Permit.
