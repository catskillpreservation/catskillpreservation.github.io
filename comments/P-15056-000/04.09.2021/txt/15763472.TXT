I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the proposed hydro project.

What a amazing wonder NY state has created in the form of the Ashokan Dam Rail Trail. We have enjoyed walking, biking and skiing along this trail along with many other nature lovers. I would suggest that it is a GREAT draw for NY state tourism, we certainly brought our business to the region to enjoy the beauty of this treasure along Route 28.

This new project would disturb the pristine forest that surrounds the trail, would potentially affect streams and even the NYC reservoir watershed. I am absolutely opposed to sending high voltage wires over Route 28. The spectacular views of the historic Catskill mountains would be marred. 

Please do not allow this project to proceed!
