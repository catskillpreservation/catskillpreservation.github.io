  Re: DOCKET P-15056-000 

  MOTION TO INTERVENE of Melissa Rabuffo for the Premium Energy
  Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

  Dear Secretary Bose, 

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed PROJECT NO. 15056-000, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC,
Walnut, CA. Melissa Rabuffo is filing a motion to be an intervener and
meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations
to be granted full party status. 

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project
Project No. 15056-000 would affect our business and the project path of
the tunnel would directly go under our property endangering our access
to clean water for our family and substantially affect the property
value of our home. Therefore, I have substantial interest in the matter.
I reside on 59 Cinder Road, Chichester, NY.  

Melissa Rabuffo respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene. 

  Respectfully, 

  Melissa Rabuffo

  59 Cinder Road, Chichester, NY 12416
