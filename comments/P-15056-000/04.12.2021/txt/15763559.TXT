Docket P-15056
Premium Energy Project for the Ashokan Reservoir

I am writing to express my opposition to Premium Energyâ€™s proposal to build a hydro-electric plant at the Ashokan Reservoir and a related upper reservoir and dam.

I am a lifelong resident of the area, who is an avid snowboarder and licensed fisherman.  

This project is bad for our area on so many different levels.  It uses more energy than it produces and would disrupt the unique ecology and communities of the region.  Regardless of the reservoir option that is selected, any of these choices would hurt the recreational activities here and harm the associated businesses and employees that rely on tourism.  

This land and its waterways are supposed to be protected.  I hope that FERC rejects this proposal immediately and completely.

Thank you.
