The Ashokan is a valuable watershed and protected area. It now attracts tourism through the use of its newly opened trails. This supports local bussinesses. We do not need a questionable project by an out of state company compromising this resource area so rich in natural beauty, low impact recreation such as hiking and fishing. We cannot get back what we destroy and we will be destroying nature and impacting people's lives.
