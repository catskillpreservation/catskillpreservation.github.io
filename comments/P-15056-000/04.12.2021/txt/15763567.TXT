Hello, 
I hope you are having a great day and end to your week. I am writing to inform you that I and my family oppose the development of the Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant. The Catskills Forest & Water Preserve is an integral component that will ensure the health and prosperity of human life now and for future generations. The Catskills Preserve is also considered STATUS 1 under the USGS; which means we should avoid developing the land and do whatever it takes to protect it. Please do not move forward with the proposal for development. It will only hurt and damage the community. 

Thank you for your time
all the best
John Simon
