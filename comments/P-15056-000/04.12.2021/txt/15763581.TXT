Please do not allow the dam project to go forward in the Catskill Forest Preserve. This is one of the most beautiful areas in the world, and according to Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” There is no reason for these beautiful lands to be destroyed by a huge dam, and no reason for the Esopus Creek, which I once lived near and loved, to be overwhelmed and also destroyed. This whole project is an example of corporate cheating. Premium is claiming that is will be “closed-loop,” but projects in which an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are “add-on” projects, and that’s what this project is. Please do not allow this sort of corruption to destroy a cherished, precious, and prosperous region. I have been thinking of returning to the area. I would be heart-broken if it were destroyed.
