To Whom It May Concern:
     The proposed pump storage hydroelectric plant must NOT be allowed to be constructed in the area it's seeking to get a foot-hold in. According to the NYS Constitution this area of the state "shall be forever kept as wild forest lands", and no matter how safe or economically sound their proposal sounds, things with projects of this magnitude always seem to go awry. 
     Besides the fact that many people and communities will be forever disrupted, there is always the threat of things going wrong at a cost to the environment ---wildlife habitats will be drastically changed and/or eliminated; altering the sediment flow in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the most vital trout waters in the Catskills, doing great harm to valuable trout breeding habitats; and needless to say, tourism in this area would be greatly affected with the loss or destruction of any part of this beautiful natural environment.
     Premium Energy will try to sell what they say is best for this part of the state, but it appears that they are more interested in trying to make as much money as they can! I say NO to this entire proposal/project.

                                                                                              Michael J. Boyer
