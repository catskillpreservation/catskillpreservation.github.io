Regarding P-15056, I strongly disapprove of the proposed interference to the Catskill Preserve. Protected land, it should remain so for habitat, recreation enjoyment and especially for keeping the Ashokan Reservoir and watershed area safe for its drinking water. Health and safety are seriously involved

NYDEC was not consulted and all the major groups involved with the environment, land and river systems have alerted me to the details and its negative consequences. This is not only negative for me and generations now alive, but for future ones as well.

Please reject this pipeline intervention proposal 

Sincerely and concerned,

Jane Levenson
