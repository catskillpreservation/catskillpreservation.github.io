Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

As a Catskill, NY resident I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it will illegally disrupt the forest preserve as well as the lives of people living in the area, and poses risks to the drinking water of millions of people. 

The Catskill region is a chartered forest preserve for a reason: it is a rare continuous wildlife habitat. Our increasing awareness of the interconnectedness of ecosystems makes it even more imperative that we maintain the forest’s health. This proposal stands to significantly disrupt that balance in a destructive and devastating manner. 

In addition the region features one of the most renowned water systems and aquifers in the world, a system millions of people depend upon for clean drinking water. Threatening that system is irresponsible in a time of precarious climate events and climate instability. 

To be clear I’m supportive of alternative energy initiatives, and am aware that they often prompt a “not in my backyard” response. In this case, however, the environmental costs appear to outweigh the benefits. For these reasons and many more I encourage you to deny the permit. 

Sincerely, 
Dr. Suzanne Thorpe
