Docket number P-15056-000

My name is Maya Raffaele. I am 11 years old and live in Woodland Valley, Phoenicia, one of the locations  Premium Energy Holdings plans to build a dam. I know that your concerns are not within a personal perspective but in my opinion, the fact that it would be destroying people's homes should be at the top of the list. But it is not just peoples’ homes that will be getting demolished, countless plants and animals will be gone. There are also protected species and habitats that will be threatened:

The bog orchid, trout waters, many birds (Audubon Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area): raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, New york threatened northern long eared bat, to name a few.


There are also historical sights that would be destroyed, which include:

The Roxmore Inn- visited by naturalist John Burroughs

The William L. Beach house, occupied by Thomas Craig, nature painter

The Emil Brunel Studio and Sculpture garden

Living near the Woodland Valley campground, I get to see how many people come to camp, hike, and fish. What would happen to the trails and the campground?

Two ski resorts, shops, restaurants, inns will be also be in trouble if the dam is built. This means that people will lose their homes and jobs.    

I know that the words of an 11 year old might seem insignificant and silly, but I think I speak for most of the Woodland Valley residents (and of the other possible locations) when I say that our lives and the lives of countless animals would be completely turned upside down if this proposal is accepted. 


Sincerely,
Maya Raffaele
