The proposal from Premium Energy of Walnut, CA concerning a pumped storage facility using water from the lower (west) basin of the Ashokan Reservoir in New York State (New York City watershed) does not even one single thing to address our biggest problem on Plant Earth or to support the biggest solution to that problem:

NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) announced today (April 9, 2021) that level of carbon dioxide on Earth is highest in 3.6 million years, a time when sea level was 78 feet higher than today and temperature was 7 degrees warmer (as opposed to the 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees that we have set as a goal for 2050).  Conditions on the surface of the earth are THE ONLY THING keeping us from the 6th mass extinction that has been predicted.  Some scientists predict the de-evolution (or devolution) of the oceans (from temperatures and/or plastic—who knew, “death by plastic”) in as little as 8-12 years, a point after which there is NO-THING we can do to avoid extinction.

The Premium Energy plan does not add energy to the grid, uses more power than it stores, is expensive financially AND is likely to be a disruptive force in the ecology of the reservoir as well as the Esopus Creek and its tributaries (due to rapid changes in water level).

This is a NO WIN.  It is NON-SENSE.  It is people trying to extract some numbers (“metrics” and “monetizing”) from a situation. It must be denied.  Send them back to the drawing board to do something useful. Thank you.
