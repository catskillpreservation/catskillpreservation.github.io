Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval; that’s why Premium is claiming to be “closed-loop.” 

• Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects; that’s what this really is. YOU are lying. 

• “Initial construction impacts” for these projects are lower, but “operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the add on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.”

Note the DOE comments above and fulfill transparency and honesty practices. 
This is a plan about making money for the very few with catastrophic impacts for the many, the environment, and for future residents.
