Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I grew up in West Shokan, part of the beautiful Catskill Forest Preserve. My father still lives there, my mother is buried there, and my husband and I plan to take over the family home and die there ourselves. This place has deep meaning for me and my family. I am writing to urge you to reject the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in this place I consider hallowed ground. I don't think I have to tell you how much a place can mean to a person. We all have our special places.

Please deny Premium Energyâ€™s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Alice Bierhorst
