I am a resident of one of Olive, NY in an area that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings in docket number P-15056-000. The large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels that may be installed for storage and generation of electricity would significantly change the area. 

Preserving a portion of New York in the bounds of the Catskill Preserve is critical to maintain significant land, diversity and recreation for the future of New York for its residents and visitors. The Catskills thrive with ecotourism and altering the landscape may have a significant economic impact to the area that so many businesses and residents rely on.

Changing the paths of the water has the potential of impacting  fish species, habitat and surface water runoff. The Catskill area is centered on clean free flowing streams that have been captured in the reservoir system that was constructed 100 years ago. The reservoir system is critical in providing unfiltered drinking water to nine million people in New York City.

I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
