P-15056 Pump Storage

April 10, 2021

As a life-long resident of Greene County NY, living half a lifetime within the Town of Hunter and now in the Town of Catskill, I hold tremendous respect for those that make the "Mountain Top "their home- for generations.  
 
In short this Pumped-Storage  Hydro Plant would have a negative impact on these areas for various reasons:

-	The Ashokan  Reservoir  ( Department of Environmental Protection /DEP) provides the City of New York with approximately 40% of its water, this water is being pumped across from the the Gilboa Reservoir in Deleware /Schoharie County area.

-	The Proposal falls within the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation- (forever wild clause) - Protected and Historical Catskill Park/Catskill Forest Preserve.

-	In the event of a Catastrophic road failure of State Route 23A in the Town of Hunter from hamlet of Haines Falls to the Town of Catskill line hamlet of Palenville (which has occurred numerous times !) alternative routes such as State Route 214, the Platte Clove Road ( Greene County Route 16 a seasonal road-currently closed due to rock slides) , State Route 42 Lexington ( also having had Catastrophic  road failure numerous times  sometimes simultaneously ), along with use of State Route 296 to NY Route 23 are used for egress/ employment  for the Residents that live within the Towns of Hunter, Lexington, Windham , Prattsville and Jewett  respectively.   Also to mention those from the Ulster County side that use SR 214 to come into Greene County for employment. 
This would cause undue hardship for numerous residents.

-	These areas are dependent on Tourism.  Access to our regions ski areas, hiking trails and camping facilities both private and state run, historical areas, restaurants’ etc. are destinations for travelers and contribute to our economic and environmental growth.

-	As small communities they are Very Dependent on Volunteer  Mutual Aid  for Fire and EMS Services.


-	Electricity for the hamlet of Lanesville , Edgewood , Chichester, Stony Clove is run from the Phoneicia area and ends at the NYS Campground – Devil’s Tombstone. 

How would SR 214 be re-routed?    Roads such as Diamond Notch, Silver Hollow and  Broadstreet  Hollow are all dead ended for numerous reasons. 

As there are more reasons to list as to environmental impacts, quality of life and economic impacts, this expansive project would be devastating to the communities involved and does not belong here.



Sincerely ,
Mary Sheridan
