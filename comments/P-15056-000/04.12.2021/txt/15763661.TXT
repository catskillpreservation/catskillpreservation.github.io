Dear Secretary Bose,

     This proposal by Premium Energy has been poorly thought out and the application is misleading; it will do far more harm to the environment and the affected communities than any potential benefit it might offer on the path towards de-carbonization. 
-This is erroneously shown as a “closed loop system” when in fact there is a river running in and out of both the proposed upper reservoir (in all three locations) and the existing “lower” reservoir

-When calculating the affect of a pump cycle on the Ashokan reservoir, Premium Energy used the surface area of the entire reservoir. They failed to take into account the fact that the Ashokan is split into two basins separated by a weir. They would be drawing from and dumping into the upper basin only. When this fact is calculated out, their assumed 2 foot rise over the whole reservoir becomes an actual 5 foot change in height in just the upper basin. This will cause a massive disruption in the homeostasis of the reservoir, and the Ashokan is part of the largest unfiltered public water supply in the world. Has Premium studied the increase in turbidity levels and how that would affect the water quality for the more than 9 million residents of New York City?

-The entire proposal is sited in the Catskill Forest Preserve. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”. Has Premium energy or FERC looked into the legality of running afoul of the New York State Constitution? 

-Since the proposal makes use of existing watersheds, it will be disruptive to the natural inhabitants of these areas, such as Brook trout and the threatened Bald Eagles that call this area home. The Ashokan as well as the streams that would be dammed by this proposal are both nesting and foraging sites for Bald Eagles.  The conservation efforts that have pulled Bald Eagle populations back to more sustainable levels are one of America’s great conservation success stories; and one of the many reasons this preserve area was set aside to begin with. Has premium looked into the affect of the of the long construction period on the these ecologically sensitive habitats?
-Has Premium energy shown the ability to actually power this facility with renewable energy? These projects are put forth as “batteries” for renewable energy, but often in practice are often run off of fossil fuels creating the worst of all worlds.

-Excavation intensive projects such as reservoirs and tunnels require a disproportionally large amount of heavy construction equipment which, even with today’s tighter emissions standards still require the burning of large amounts of diesel fuel. Has Premium Energy taken into account the environmental toll of this fossil fuel use during construction vs any perceived gain down the road? 

-These locations in particular would also require the relocation of major through roads as well as the relocation of hundreds of people and homes. This would only add to the construction costs and environmental toll. All these things taken together paint a very clear picture that these proposed locations are poorly suited for this purpose

We all know that we need to find a better way forward to preserve this planet for future generations. But we have to begin by taking the total cost of our actions into account. I urge you to deny this application by Premium Energy on the grounds of being based on false or misleading information and their failure to take the true cost of this project, in these locations, into account.  

  Thank you for your consideration,
    Cliff Rabuffo
