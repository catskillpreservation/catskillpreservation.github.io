Iâ€™m incredibly concerned and vehemently opposed to this proposal. This proposal would unnecessarily tamper with national forest preserve, privately owned land, homes, jobs, local economy, and pose threats NYC water supply. This proposal breaks laws and is a threat to my 200 year old home in Shokan. This area should be protected from ever having to go through this kind of trauma again after the building of the ashokan reservoir.
