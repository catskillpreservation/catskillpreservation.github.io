As a resident of Olive, I am extremely concerned about this invasive project â€” we purchased our home and land to preserve the integrity of the natural landscape, as well as the social history of the town. Our house and barn date back 200-years (it was built by the Elmendorf family, original settlers of the area) as a homestead. This historic property and corresponding land would be directly threatened by the project, which would not only be a loss for our family, but for the entire community, as this is one of the few properties that survived the construction of the Ashokan Reservoir 100-years ago. As the land continues to heal from the devastation of the last water initiative, the proposed project would destroy that progress. This must not move forward.
