It's my understanding that this proposal and the building of a dam/power plant will result in destruction of the environment, therefore I object.  There has got to be a better way, with a company which will not arrogantly enter the property of others, flood homes, destroy and pollute what was a protected area, flooding homes, forcing humans and wildlife out, and probably creating many other problems we are not aware of.  I agree with all the objections stated by others who object.  Sorry I can'
t type very much due to a computer based hand injury.  Please acknowledge and accept my protest.  Thank you.
