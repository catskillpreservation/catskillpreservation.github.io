RE: The proposed Ashokan Reservoir Pumped Storage and Hydro-electric Project
        Docket P-15056

Dear Commissioners:
 
The Mountaintop Mayors and Supervisors Association, an organization representing the nine Greene County communities that lie within the northeast Catskill Mountains, recently reviewed the application submitted by Premium Energy and discussed at its March 2021 meeting.  We submit the following comments opposing this application:
  
•         It is not practical that Premium Energy would be able to secure property rights for exploration or development, especially on lands owned by NYCDEP and the NYS constitutionally protected Catskill Park Forest Preserve, which prevents any development public or private for the greater public good.  The applicant should prove it could get the authorizations necessary to proceed before granting a preliminary permit.
•         The geology of the region is challenged by turbidity during flood events, resulting in water quality impairment from suspended clay soils which can last for days or weeks depending on the magnitude of the flood event.  The project would significantly disturb the Ashokan reservoir system on which NYCDEP relies to provide high quality drinking water to approximately 9 million residents.
•         The environmental impacts would be overwhelming to the landscape, wildlife and aquatic resources.  The applicant should prove first the workability of this project given the substantive comments submitted to the Commission. 
•         The application was poorly put together, with minimal information.  That should be an indication the applicant did not know about or care to research the challenges it would up against proposing the project in this highly sensitive, protected region of NYS. 
•         One of the proposed reservoir locations is in Lanesville, the Town of Hunter, Greene County.  We support the Town of Hunter in decrying what that would do to the hamlet of Lanesville, through which a NYS-designated scenic byway runs (State Route 214).
 
The upstate communities and NYC have had an acrimonious relationship over the years since the takings of whole communities to build their reservoir system and more often than not are on the opposite end of watershed issues.  When it comes to this, however, we fully agree with the City of New York and respectfully request FERC deny this application and save everyone considerable time, expense and heartache given the exorbitant challenges inherent with this proposal. 
 
The Mountaintop Mayors and Supervisors Association (MMSA) represents the towns of Hunter, Windham, Prattsville, Ashland. Lexington, Jewett, Halcott and the Villages of Hunter and Tannersville.

Thank you for your attention.
Yours truly,
James Pellitteri, Jewett Town Supervisor, and Secretary of the MMSA
