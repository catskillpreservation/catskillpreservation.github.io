This proposed project is out of scale to the area and not energy efficient and would encroach on sensitive ecosystems, including Catskill Park/New York State forever wild lands.  

We are all for renewable and sustainable energy.  But this project is not right for this area. Why in the world would you want to pump water upstream to create a massive closed loop system?  This would be highly inefficient and totally unnecessary. Exploring smaller scale projects would be smarter and more cost effective, and not infringe nearly as much on the beautiful ecosystem we have here.

The future will be in energy efficiency, but this is not efficient.  Not only is there an obviously huge waste of energy in this proposed concept, but energy is also wasted as soon as it enters the grid.  There are much better solutions to solving our energy challenges, so please think about long term effects of this project. 

We love this area and are deeply invested in taking care of it for future generations.
Let us work together for safer sustainable energy.
