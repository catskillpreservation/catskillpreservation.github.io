I write to protest in the strongest possible terms the interest by Premium Energy  Holding LLC in the Ashoka Pumped Storage Project. It is a truly terrible idea which no one supports. It will destroy our homes, cause needless environmental destruction, seriously affect the quality of New York City’s drinking water. And all for a minimal power gain. Maximum destruction of people’s lives, water quality, wildlife and environment for a minimal power gain makes absolutely no sense. Please do not permit this company to go ahead. It is unfair to the human beings and animals who live happily here.
Thank you, 
Michael Rosenthal
