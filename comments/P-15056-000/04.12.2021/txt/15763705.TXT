Hi,
I am a New York State resident and I care about the Catskill Forest Preserve that this proposed Dam would effect. I do not want to see this beautiful spot of nature modified or changed by any company looking to build a dam. 
It would change the area ecological systems and displace many living creatures. The plants and wildlife that is there now, would be changed forever if this dam is created. I do not agree to this.
There are other methods to create energy, why not use those alternatives rather than modifying the Catskills.
