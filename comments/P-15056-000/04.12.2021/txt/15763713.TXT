I am writing to urgently press you to deny this permit for the pump plant here.
This is all protected land and wildlife. And the proposed plan would threaten and destroy many species that call this area home. There are so many other suitable barren areas where such a project could happen but please not here. As an environmental activist and amateur botanist, I am deeply disturbed that this is even being proposed here.
Thanks for your mindful consideration,
Jennifer Charles
