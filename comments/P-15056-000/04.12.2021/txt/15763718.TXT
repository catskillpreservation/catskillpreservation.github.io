I do agree with the concept of renewable energy,  but not at the expense of the integrity of a century old dam  and the ecological upheaval of the Catskill Park Watershed. Everything about the project is too evasive for this fragile location.  Premium Energy's proposal for the West Shokan hydro-electric pump station may look good on paper, but not in reality. Thank you for considering my concern.
