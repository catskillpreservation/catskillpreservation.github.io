I am extremely concerned that this project will not only harm the local community and economy, but do irreparable damage to the state protected forest and unique ecosystem that is the Catskill mountains. This project seems incredibly invasive and with seemingly no input from local authorities prior to the proposal, it feels like a slap in the face to all of us who call these mountains home. Please do not move forward with this application and keep the Catskills as they are. Thank you.
