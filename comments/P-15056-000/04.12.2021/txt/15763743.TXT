Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

The Catskill Forest Preserve is protected by New York state’s constitution to be forever kept as a wild forest and no part of it can be transferred to another entity, whether public or private. An hydroelectric plant would be devastating for the Preserve and its wildlife, the surrounding community, and for New York City’s water system which has been centuries in the making and is considered an example to others around the nation.

As a New Yorker who takes great pride in our water system and as a visitor to this area for its well-known bird-watching opportunities, I implore you to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely, 
Eileen Gumport
