Personal Comments on Docket # P-15056

I am an artist and cultural entrepreneur whose career, over more than 40 years, has focused on the natural beauty and resources of the Catskill Park and the Catskill Watershed. I feel it is a responsibility and to live in this protected area, with its special mix of public and private lands.

The proposed project would destroy one of the major tributaries of the Esopus Creek, whichever one of the three sites chosen. The Esopus Creek is the principle source for the Ashokan Reservoir, which provides 40% of the fresh water for New York City. I know this will be emphasized in many comments opposing this dangerous proposal.

Indeed, the proposal is so ignorant of the special status of this area that it is laughable for it to be considered. It has served the purpose of uniting many residents and organizations in opposition and I am astonished the people behind this scheme allowed their resources to be committed to such a doomed project.

The devastation any one of these three proposed dams and retaining ponds would wreck on the creeks, critical roads and surrounds lands is opposed to the mandate of protection in the New York State constitution protecting the Catskill Park and Watershed.

I support a rejection of this pumped storage hydro proposal. Do not inflict years of futile aggravation on our communities by letting this impractical and dangerous project linger with life. Reject it now! Thank you.

Respectfully,

Robert Selkowitz
