A proposed hydroelectric facility in the Catskill's Ashokan Reservoir would irreversibly damage areas of the Catskill Forest Preserve, threaten the experience of hikers and nature enthusiasts, endanger the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve and threaten the quality of New York City's water supply!
As a New York State resident, as a mother and grandmother, as a hiker, as someone who loves the Catskills, as a person who drinks NYC tap water, I am very concerned.
