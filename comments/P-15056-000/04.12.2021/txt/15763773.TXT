I am writing to express my strong opposition toward Docket P-15056, a proposed dam and pumped storage project. This project lies within the Catskills Forest Preserve, which is protected very explicitly in the NY State Constitution. I am a frequent user of the forest preserve, especially the area around the Ashokan Reservoir, as it lies most proximal to the NYC metro area. This proposed development would cause significant harm to hiking, biking, fishing, and sightseeing in the area. These uses have only become only more important and popular since the beginning of the pandemic, and they provide a critical source of economic opportunity to the local area. I am urging federal regulators to block this proposal as both unconstititional and excessively harmful to the 
Catskill economy, recreational experience, and ecology.
