To FERC,

What is being constructed is a machine. It is extremely costly to build this machine. It will occupy large amounts of land. What does this machine do? It pumps water to a higher elevation using electricity. Is the water needed at the higher elevation? 

NO!!

The machine does produce electricity from a turbine, but it consumes all the electricity it produces and needs more to operate. Overall it is not a generator.

Why build such a machine if there is no need for water at a higher elevation? 

It seems to me that this is not about producing clean energy. It is about a company that wants to make money using land and resources located in the Catskill Mountains. It is not beneficial to local residents who will lose their homes and property. 

I will not discuss the negative environmental impact this project will have. I am sure there are plenty other letters you will receive which will do this. 

People come to the Catskills to enjoy undisturbed nature. We should try and keep it that way. Unfortunately it has become a desirable place to make money using the natural resources in the area.
 
It is a losing proposition. Wasteful time and money will be spent. It consumes more energy than it produces.

For these reasons I adamantly oppose this project.

Sincerely,
Peter Beyl
