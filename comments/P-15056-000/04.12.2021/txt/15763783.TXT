In reference to Premium Energy Holdings LLC Preliminary Permit application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, docket P-15056,  I’d like to express my deepest concerns about the effect it will have on a very sensitive environment.

As a native to Ulster County, with one side of my family having their farm covered by the Ashokan Reservoir and the other having an engineer who worked to build it, this area is one I’ve known my whole life.

From all that I’ve read about this project it’s incredibly ill-conceived. While I truly believe in renewable energy and the need for more options — this project is not the correct one for the area.

Please hear the voices of the residents of this area and all who depend on the drinking water from the Ashokan and the Esopus.

Thank you.
