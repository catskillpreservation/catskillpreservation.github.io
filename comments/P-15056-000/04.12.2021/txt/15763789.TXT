Dear Ms. Bose,
I hope this finds you well.
With dismay -- I write in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings of California to build
a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir, Town of Olive, Ulster County, in New Yorkâ€™s
Catskill Mountains. This would include a reservoir of up to 300 acres at one of three sites (to be
chosen) and a tunnel to bring the water to the east shore of the upper basin of the Ashokan
Reservoir. The three sites are Chichester, Woodland Valley, and the Moonhaw valley in the hamlet
of West Shokan, Town of Olive. My comments are confined to the Moonhaw and adjacent regions of
West Shokan.
Moonhaw is a settled area of some 50 homes, valued at up to $2,500,000 apiece. A 300-acre
reservoir would destroy the community -- and the tunnel leading from it would disrupt another 50
homes in the region between Moonhaw and the proposed power plant.
Furthermore the upper reaches of the Moonhaw valley are in a designated Wilderness
Area of the New York State Forest Preserve and protected from development of any kind by
the "forever wild" clause of the New York State Constitution.
Such wholesale destruction of a major portion of West Shokan cannot be allowed. I urge you to
recommend that Premium Energy's proposal be rejected.

Please strongly consider my points. Thank you.

Kindly,
