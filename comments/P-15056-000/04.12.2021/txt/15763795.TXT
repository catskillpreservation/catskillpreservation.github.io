Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to comment on the proposed hydropower storage plant for preliminary permit for Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP under P-15056.  My first impression of the propsal is what it lacked and how little they know about this area steeped in history, the ecological importance of the lands protected by NY State, the NY City Department of Protection, protecting the Ashokan reservoir which supplies 40% of the water to NYC, as well as private land owners and multiple conservation groups.  First and most glaringly obvious would be the forests around the proposed sites rank among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, and are considered Status 2 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

The fracture of the nearly 700,000 continuous acreage of the Catskill Preserve is at risk.  This Preserve is considered to be on of the most ecologically diverse in the northeast.  

Premium Energy proposes using NY State land which is currently protected as "forever wild" by the NY State constitution.   In addition, NY City lands, protecting the largest in the chain of reservoirs that supplies the City with "some of the most pristine, pure, potable water in the country" would also be obtained by Premium under eminent domain.  

I urge you to reconsider the permit application submitted by Premium Energy for the Ashokan PSP project.  

Thank you for your consideration.
