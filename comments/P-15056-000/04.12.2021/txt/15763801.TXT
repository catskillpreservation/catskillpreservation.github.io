To: Kimberly D. Bose Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First St. NE, Room 1A Washington, D.C. 20426.
Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056

Project application is misrepresented as “closed loop” design. This is a project where a new upper reservoir will be added to an existing lower reservoir. Costly and long term project that will impact wildlife on teritory of Catskill preserve, threaten quality of water that supplies NY state and negatively impact many local residents. This not the right place for the green alternative that we need

Sincerely,
Daria
