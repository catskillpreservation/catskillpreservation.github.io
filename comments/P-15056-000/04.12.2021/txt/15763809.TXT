Although I am not generally one to become politically involved, the proposal for a hydroelectric plant is so absurd that I just had to say something.  As you are busy I am sure, here are a few brief bullet points detailing the most egregious flaws in the proposal

1) The NYS Constitution - it is guaranteed that the Catskill Forest Preserve "shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be be taken by any corporation public or private"

2) Ecology - pumped storage destroys the ecosystem.  Sediment is altered, the water increases in turbidity, etc.  To make matters worse, almost half of NYC (about 9 million people) depend on water from the reservoir - which is part of the largest unfiltered water system in the world

3) Economics -  People come from all over the world to view the unspoiled views of the Ashokan reservoir and surrounding areas.  Development of this type would destroy the tourism industry in the Catskills - which currently generates 2 billion dollars a year and supplies 20% of the region's employment

4) We've seen this movie before from Premium Energy Holdings - they lie and fast-track their projects through subterfuge and "surprise filings"

Take a look at this:

In summary, there is no logical reason to sacrifice one of the last remaining forest habitats close to NYC for a couple of kilowatts
