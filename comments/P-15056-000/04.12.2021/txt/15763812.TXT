As so well said by Executive Director of Catskill Central, "the project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings is ill-conceived and does not take into account the barriers to its implementation including the impacts to critical habitat, New York City water supply, Catskill Park Forest Preserve Lands, and the presence of communities within areas where upper basins are proposed. This project does not belong in the Catskill Park and should not move forward."
