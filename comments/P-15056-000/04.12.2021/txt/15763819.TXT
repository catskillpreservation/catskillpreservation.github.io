I am writing in regards to Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydropower plant. While it is necessary to remove our dependence on fossil fuels, a dam in these locations would likely cause ecological issues.

Having worked several years in agroforesty in many local counties, I can attest to how important stream and land ecology is to maintain wildlife species found in the Catskills. Prior to conservation efforts many important plants and animals in the Catskills were either endangered or ceased to exist altogether. By allowing wild lands to stay undisturbed we gives struggling species a chance to regenerate and thrive. The suggested areas of this proposal are ranked in the top 1% of forest habitats according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. “Differences in microclimate, predation levels, invasive species, and other disturbance at forest edges produces effects that can extend 100 meters or more into forest patches” (https://www.nynhp.org/documents/98/forest_condition_index_hshjI31.pdf).

Diverting water can cause a rapid decline in forest health, which in turn greatly affects local flora and fauna. In the Woodland Valley area, trout breeding areas would be disturbed and the impact of such a large-scale project would likely impact their spawning conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eff.12210).

Clearing trees for power lines and tunnels to move water will greatly affect local bird populations. The Bicknell’s Thrush is listed with a S2S3B rank and is of special concern to NYS conservation due to the breeding habitat according the New York Natural Heritage Program (https://www.nynhp.org/documents/1/rare_animals_2017.pdf). This species was only recently determined to be a new species and has a “has a limited summer range in the northeast” for breeding (https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/bicknells-thrush).

There are numerous species of at-risk birds that populate and breed in these areas, such as the American Black Duck, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and the Cerulean Warbler (https://www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area). There has not been enough research conducted into these species in order to fully understand the impact of building this project around these ecosystems.

Pumped hydro storage creates situations where water rapidly adjusts reservoir water levels to produce electricity. This would place an incredible strain on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Local wildlife cannot react to those immediate shifts in water levels. These habitats would become uninhabitable and inhospitable to many species (https://e360.yale.edu/features/for_storing_electricity_utilities_are_turning_to_pumped_hydro).

Allowing Premium Energy to build in the Catskill Preserve sets a dangerous precedent for the sake of cleaner energy at the cost of wildlife and habitat loss. There are likely better options available that should be researched and considered in order to gain the benefits of hydroelectricity while maintaining ecological diversity.
