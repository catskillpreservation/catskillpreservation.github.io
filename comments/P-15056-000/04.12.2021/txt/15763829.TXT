Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline this permit. Of course alternative energy sources are important for our future, but to consider placing this type of open loop system in a Status 1 area as this is designated by the USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.

Please decline this application

Sincerely,

Michael Pezzolla
