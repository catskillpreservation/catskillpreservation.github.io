Iâ€™m writing to express opposition to the proposed hydroelectric dam in Catskill State Preserve. The Ashokan Reservoir is a key water supply for New York City and could be put in jeopardy by such a hastily designed project. The impact on the ecology and potential flood risks  of the surrounding areas has also not been fully assessed. I urge that you please do not move forward with this proposal.
