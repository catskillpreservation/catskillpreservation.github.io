I am opposed to the project.

As a retired business owner of a second-home building company over 35 years in the town of Phoenicia, I know first-hand how this would affect the tourist industry and tourist appeal of our Catskills.  A project of this magnitude, spanning many years, would destroy our tourist economy. The Catskill Park is 2 hours from NYC. We are an area to decompress from the stress of our modern world. The importance of a pristine escape can never be overstated.

1.	 Large electric towers will ruin our pristine mountain views.
2.	These high power electric lines give off an electrical field which effects all living things.
3.	Our sensitive environment would be threatened, nesting sites destroyed, animal breeding grounds and migratory paths disrupted.
4.	Increased noise levels will affect all life.
5.	The project would increase our carbon footprint.
6.	Large trucks, hauling dirt supplies, concrete will ruin our roads.
7.	Our world renowned trout streams will be destroyed.
8.	The park supplies drinking water for New York City.   The increased movement of water will expand turbidity.
For this and many other reasons, please reject this proposal.
