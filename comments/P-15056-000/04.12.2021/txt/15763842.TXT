Hello,

As a current resident of Ulster County (about 20 minutes away from the site of the proposed plant) and former resident of NYC, Iâ€™d like to register my strong opposition to this poorly thought out proposal. The loss of preserved wilderness, risk to NYC water supply, and loss of homes in no way would be worth the benefit that would accrue only to a for-profit company.

As a realtor in the area and head of the largest real estate team, I can also say that the very proposal has already thrown doubt into the minds of future homebuyers in the area and would and is already lowering the value of properties around the proposed site.

I hope that this will be swiftly shut down.

Thank you,
Megan Brenn-White
