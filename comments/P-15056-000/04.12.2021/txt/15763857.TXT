Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to register my opposition to the Premium Energy Holdings application to build a hydroelectric power plant in the Catskills region. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities and risky to NYC’s drinking water.

It is evident that under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  This is an essential provision to uphold and insure that we protect the watershed system and avoid negative impact to Esopus Creek and the wildlife that depend on it. In addition, the Ashokan Reservoir supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system—but is an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. 

I am personally opposed to the use of  eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing. As Town of Olive Supervisor Jim SoFranco so clearly stated “Once is Enough!” 

Please reject Premium Energy’s plan for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
