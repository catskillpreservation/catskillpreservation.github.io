  Please do not grant a development permit to Premium Energy.

   The following statements of New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection in regard to Premium Energy’s “fatal flaws” makes an undeniably strong case against the project.
1.  The land that Premium wants to use near the Ashokan Reservoir is "part of the Catskill Forest Preserve, for which sale, lease and development are prohibited under the New York Constitution.”
2.  “Under Section 21 of the FPA (Federal Power Act), the federal right of eminent domain would be unavailable to Premium Energy even in the remote possibility that the commission ever grants it a license. Accordingly, Premium Energy will never be able to gain control of those lands.”
3.  “Put simply," the DEP filing said, "this is a poorly conceived, inappropriate project that should be stopped before it can cause any damage to the water supply system or the environment, or the imposition of billions of dollars of incremental costs on New York [City] consumers for ... [a] filtration system” that could become necessary if the turbidity becomes unmanageable.

   I will add that the construction of the Ashokan Reservoir in the early 20th Century was, for this area, a traumatic event that destroyed more than a dozen towns and required hundreds of people to leave their land, their farms, their homes.  The effects of this dislocation are still being felt.  As a result, this is not an area where a development project such as the one proposed will be welcomed in any way.  You should expect all legal avenues to be explored. 
So, a sloppily thought out project in an area that is environmental sensitive and with a population that will be in full opposition seems a very bad idea.
