The project would flood over 200 acres to construct a new reservoir, with a dam as high as 300 feet. It would be connected to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel up to 50 feet wide and many miles long, drilled under both public and private lands. It would threaten endangered species, damage water supply for wells, impact the NYC water supply, block tourism, and cut revenue for our area -to name just a few of the negative impacts.
