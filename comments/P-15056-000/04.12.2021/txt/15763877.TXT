As a frequent visitor to the Catskills and someone who consumes the filtered water supply daily in my Brooklyn apartment, I object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

After reviewing the plan and seeing how it would affect not only the people who frequently visit such as myself, but the land's ecology itself. This will create wreak havoc on the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems that overlap.

The State forest preserved land, states that the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS "Gap Analysis Program" And under the DOE's Hydropower Vision, Status land 1 should be avoided for development. 

Furthermore, This would plan is not sufficient to meet the DOE standards of a closed loop as the plan would affect the upper reservoir which will affect the it's natural flowing original structure. 

This is not the risk to take that could affect the economy, millions of people and their homes and lastly the ecology of our natural lands. This proposal by Premium Energy will damage more than what we've has already been done.
