I am opposed to all aspects of this project. The proposed reservoir location (letâ€™s be honest, the one seriously targeted is the Wittenberg location). That would destroy the grandeur, natural beauty and overall healthy environment permanently. Plus endanger the NYC water supply. This is a pricelessly preserved area, a vital resource, enjoyed by local people and many, many thousands of visitors a year. No to all meddling with this!

Thank you. Please feel free to contact me for further comment.
