As a resident of Olivebridge, New York, a rural community close to the Ashokan Reservoir, I am writing to express my opposition to the hydroelectric plant proposed by Premium Energy Holdings.  The proposed project with its upper basin and use of the Ashokan Reservoir, construction of dams and tunnels will have a significant negative impact on the local wildlife, natural resources, the homes and communities, and public lands which make our area so beautiful and peaceful.  I urge you to reject this proposal to retain valuable and fragile environment surrounding the Ashokan Reservoir.

Sincerely yours,
Carol Monteleoni
