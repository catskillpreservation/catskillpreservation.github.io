Dear FERC staff,
Please deny the Premium Energy Holdings hydro project in the Catskills.  The Catskills are protected by the NYS constitution and this project is in direct violation of the NYS constitution. I regularly fish in the Esopus creek and this fishery will be very negatively affected by the proposed project.  We have a home in Woodland Valley and we cherish the moments we spend with our 2 kids there.  The last thing we want is for a private California company to seize our home and put it 100 feet under water.  We also have a place in NY City and the Ashokan reservoir provides 40% of our water.  This project will negatively affect our main source of drinking water.
