New York recognizes the need to take action towards a sustainable climate pathway by becoming 70% dependent on renewable energy by 2030.  However, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings LLC is not a suitable part of that action.  The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will cause irreparable damage to water resources in the Catskills.

As a whole, the Catskill/Delaware Water Supply meets 90% of the drinking water needs for 9.5 million people of New York City – one billion gallons per day of unfiltered water.  New York City is one of five major cities that has a surface water system that doesn’t require filtration.  The proposed high elevation reservoirs of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will almost certainly increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir, through which 40% of New York City’s water supply passes, due to rapid fluctuations of water levels in the Esopus Creek tributaries.   Costs to create an upstate filtration system are estimated to be approximately $12 billion.

Now is the time for FERC to make the correct decision to deny Premium Energy Holdings’ application for a preliminary permit to conduct feasibility studies for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.
