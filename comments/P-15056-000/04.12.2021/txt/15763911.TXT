I am strongly opposed to the pumpstorage project proposed for the Catskill Mountain region of New York State. This project will have a deleterious impact on water quality that serves 9 million people by increasing turbidity and associated pollutants. It will also disrupt communities and destroy the natural habitat of the wilderness area that is part of the Catskill Mountain Park, one the first public parks established for the preservation of wildlife and wilderness in the United States.
