I'm writing in opposition to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project  (FERC Project No. 15056-000 ). The project as proposed has no clear benefit to the residents and businesses of the area in which it is proposed, describes an incomplete and flawed process, and will have a significant negative impact to the local environment.

The complete lack of input from and consideration of the impact on the local population is breathtaking. The listing of the twelve components of the project contains only one about mitigating "environmental and cultural impact" and no mention of benefit to the local populace [1]. This speaks to the fact that the proposers have no local connections, and in fact have not engaged any of the local stakeholders including residents, business owners, municipalities, New York State or the City of New York. This approach is wholly inadequate. The Biden administration is moving towards an infrastructure plan that integrates environmental justice into a restructuring of the energy sector and this proposal - by not coordinating with the local populace who will be impacted by the many externalities of this project - is totally out of sync. The only beneficiaries of this project are the company - Premium Energy Holdings - and their investors. 

Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) is an unproven technology and of questionable value to a well designed renewable energy portfolio. According to Power Magazine - an energy industry news source - 

"The industry notes, however, that the value of hydro and pumped storage hydro’s flexibility and reliability attributes are not fully understood. Like hydropower, the flexibility of pumped storage hydro has been historically constrained by the interaction of the turbines, the dam, the water flow, and the institutional agreements—and this has become increasingly critical as markets evolve to embrace more, potentially cheaper, wind and solar power.  “This results in sub-optimal designs and equipment, attrition of existing hydro resources, and stalled investments in new pumped storage hydro,” the DOE says." [2,3].

Power Magazine further goes on to describe how the US Department of Energy (DOE) is "looking to save hydropower" and that it is involved in "an effort to help the flailing industry counter stiff competition from wind and solar"[2].

Research into PSH is ongoing and standards and guidelines are just beginning to be established [4,5]. This proposal is vague about the ultimate customers of the energy storage resource, citing Independent System Operators in the northeast US [6]. In fact the value of PSH for black start operations is dubious at best [7]. Here again, a proposal such as this should not warrant serious consideration unless accompanied by collaboration and consent of local stakeholders.

Lastly, Premium Energy Holdings - a California corporation - is proposing a massively destructive build in an area wholly within New York State wilderness or wild forests. The proposed pumping stations would destroy the recreational value of these beautiful natural areas, most notably of the Ashokan Rail Trail [8] newly created and managed by Ulster County. The construction of the tunnels and upper reservoir would cause untold damage to the local ecosystem and provide an ongoing disturbance while operational.

I urge you to make certain that the above issues are addressed, and that any further feasibility study not proceed unless coordination with and consent of the many local stakeholders is obtained.
