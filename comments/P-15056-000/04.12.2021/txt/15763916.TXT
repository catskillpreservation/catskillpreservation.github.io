I'm writing in regard to the Application for Preliminary Permit P-15056 by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC. 

This preliminary permit should be denied for these reasons: 

• The land on which this project is proposed was designated Status 2 land by the USGS and not recommended for development. Each proposed dam site is listed in the inventory of USGS' PAD-US 2.1. 
• The application contains falsehoods that seek to expedite its approval: 
	• Falsehood 1: The project calls itself 'closed loop' when it is in fact 'open loop' and requires the disruption of a continuously flowing, high-value drinking water reservoir. The DOE has promoted closed rather than open loop projects; this dishonesty is careless. 
	• Falsehood 2: The proposal, wherever land ownership is mentioned, fails to mention that any land which would be flooded, disrupted, taken for high-transmission line construction, or required for the completion of the project is privately owned. Only 'New York State' or 'New York City's' lands are mentioned. Similarly, no mention is made of New York City's highly protected watershed, or the Delaware River Basin Compact, U.S. Public Law 87-328 of which Shandaken, NY is a member. 
	• Falsehood 3: The proposal presumes certain future occurrences which cannot be guaranteed, namely that the New York State Constitution will be amended to allow this project to be built and that the project will be greenlit for filtration avoidance by the US EPA. 18 CFR § 4.32(j) states that “Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.” 
	• Falsehood 4: The proposal also claims that it would be used to store excess renewable energy in section 4: “The project would store excess renewable energy, helping to integrate renewables into the grid, and to supply firm peaking power generation with primary load following capability.” This region (powered by less than 6% renewable energy) does not produce an excess of renewable energy during peak generation times, nor do local power companies seek projects like this as they can provide reliable energy via transmission upgrades, not storage upgrades: https://www.cenhud.com//my-energy/our-energy-future/capacity-zone/. Energy storage would be primarily non-renewable sources, and represent an arbitrage opportunity for Premium Energy LLC. 

The proposal's many errors, blurry and incomprehensible maps with inaccurate GPS readings, incorrect town names, (Shokan City & West Hurley city do not exist), and dishonest omissions are a signal that Premium Energy LLC does not have the capacity to embark on a project of this magnitude. FERC should not trust them with The Catskill Forest Preserve or New York City's drinking water and I respectfully request that their application be denied. 

Sincerely,
Daniel Morgan
