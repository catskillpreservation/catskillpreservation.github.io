Docket number P-15056-000

Hello,
I am someone who grew up hiking and camping on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and Slide Mountain wilderness, and the lands of New York State that are now being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. I was truly dismayed to hear about this project, particularly the lack of transparency and community input that Premium Energy Holdings has engaged in. As such, I am vigorously opposed to the proposal and I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. The NYCDEP has come out objecting to the proposal, as have many local elected officials in NY State. Premium Energy Holdings did not engage with NYC, NYS, or localities before announcing this project. Any projects such as this one that begin without input from the local community, are in my opinion, doomed to fail from the start. The social, environmental, and economic impacts of these projects are enormous; we as a nation cannot afford to get these sorts of projects wrong, and this project is not right for NY. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
Thank you,
Noah Kagan
