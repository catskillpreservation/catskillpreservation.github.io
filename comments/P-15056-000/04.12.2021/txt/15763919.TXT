Docket number P-15056-000
 
Dear Ms. Bose,
 
I am writing to you, and everyone at FERC, about the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.  I ask that this permit NOT be approved.  This project will adversely affect the place my family has chosen to settle, grow, raise our child, and retire. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains will destroy our ecosystem, endanger a reservoir that supplies drinking water for NYC, and greatly impact the local communities.  The benefits of this proposal do not outweigh the long term costs to our residents and our land. 
 
Weakness in the plan is evident:
 
·        Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife and ecosystem are at risk. The Preserve contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat protected by Article XIV of the NYS Constitution. It states, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  To move forward with the Pumped Storage Project would provide a precedent endangering all preserved land and the wildlife it supports.
·        NYC’s water supply serves a billion gallons of water daily to 9.5 million people. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will affect the sediment regime in one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, the Esopus Creek. 
·        Pumped storage damages stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. Our home is part of the Ashokan watershed and we know how delicate the ecosystem is. Without a doubt, altering the water flow will adversely affect the communion between the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.
·        Premium Energy’s proposal will be deeply damaging to local communities, which I am a part of. This project requires the use of eminent domain to take homes and property—a process that displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced. 
·        The proposed project will definitely affect the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 
The connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties will be damaged, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.
 
There are plenty of reasons to argue against the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  The fact is that this project will directly harm our environment, our community, and our livelihood on both personal and county levels. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.
 
Sincerely,

Corey M Adams
