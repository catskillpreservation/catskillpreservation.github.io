    My family has owned a home in West Shokan, NY since 1950.The proposed dam for this project will be 2 miles up stream from the Bushkill creek whish   passes near our house. My family's is 100% against this project because of damage to the natural forest and water resources that will be caused by this hydro project. The land and water in the area of this project is part of the NY state forest preserve which protected to be forever wild by NY state constitution. This land where the project will occur is also part of the Catskill's watershed which flows into the Ashokan,brings unfiltered drinking water to millions in NY city. The this project will have negative effect on the quality of this unfiltered drinking water supply. I would like the FERC  to  reject this proposed project outright for the reasons mentioned above and numerous others. Thank out. Patrick DiMilia
