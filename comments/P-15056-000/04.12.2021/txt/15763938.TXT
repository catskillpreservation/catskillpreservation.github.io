I am writing today in response - and in opposition - to the error-filled proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Forest Preserve. (Docket: P-15056-000)

I moved to this beautiful area in 2016, FROM California, home of Premium Energy. One of the reasons I moved here was the landscape. As I have made my home here, I have come to learn its history, and the price this area has already paid for “the Good of New York City.”

This proposal would not only be devastating to our area, but also would threaten the drinking water of New York City, those they purport to help.

In addition: Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the lands of the Catskills Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” So, in effect, Premium Energy has no standing to even PROPOSE this project. 

And, in addition, as the New York City Department of Environmental Protection put it: “Based on publicly-available information, it does not appear that Premium Energy has ever developed or operated any hydropower projects, and it is unclear whether it has the financial resources to address any problems it creates.” Does FERC really want to grant a permit to a company who has no idea what it's getting into, and put our entire community – and New York City’s drinking water - in peril?

I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000. It would be devastating to the environment, our local communities, and put the purity of New York City’s drinking water at great risk.

Thank you,
Steve Cunningham, Olivebridge NY
