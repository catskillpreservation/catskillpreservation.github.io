I am fully against the proposed hydro dam project on the Ashokan. I don’t agree with how this proposal has been put forward without DEP involvement or oversight and lack of community input. I think this is a bad choice for NY and too damaging to our natural environment and an important part of our wild fisheries. Not only will that negatively impact our environment but also local businesses that depend on fishing and fishing tourism for revenue. Please don’t do this!!
