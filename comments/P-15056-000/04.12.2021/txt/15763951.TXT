Dear Ms. Bose,
I strongly urge FERC to decline the request from Premium Energy Holdings for a preliminary permit (Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056) to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York's Catskill Mountains. This project is based on a deficient proposal with negative and lasting impacts on an inter-connected watershed, affecting natural habitats and communities miles and miles away. Further, the project is not accurately described; it is not a 'closed-loop' project, but really a project with an 'add-on' with an upper reservoir added to the loop. We are being lied to. 

The Catskills are an invaluable and incomparable source of beauty for New York. Every year thousands of visitors carve out time from their schedules for vacation, family gatherings, alone-time, and team-building activities in the Catskills because of it's beauty, serenity, proximity to NYC, and unique vibe. It would be an absolute shame if this incredible aspect of New York was ruined by a rushed and false proposal. New York deserves a truly innovative and sustainable alternative to the proposed project from Premium Energy Holdings. I urge you to take the time and get it right. 

Approving this proposal would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.Please decline the request by Premium Energy Holdings' request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

Thank you,
Irene Jessica Upson
