The proposed hydroelectric project will have a huge impact on the Catskills.  This area provides recreational opportunities including hiking, camping and sight seeing to not only NY residents but to adjacent states as well. The results of the devastation to this area will have a great economic impact on the Catskill region which depends on tourism for its success.  The project will displace homes, trails and camps along with the local flora and fauna.  

While the use of hydroelectric power is certainly a better option than burning of coal etc there are cheaper methods of obtaining the same results.   Wind and solar power are just as efficient and much less costly.

It is my hope that this plan will be dropped and the Catskill region can maintain its beauty for decades to come.

Thank you.
