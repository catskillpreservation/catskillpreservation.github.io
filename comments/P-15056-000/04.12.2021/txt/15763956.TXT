Dear Ms Bose,

Our drinking water and health, as well as the natural integrity of our beautiful state, should never be for sale. As someone raising a young child in NY, I can’t help but feel betrayed by the public officials considering this proposal. I implore you to reject Premium Energy’s request to pursue a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. It’s simply not worth the risk and the inevitable impact it would have on the nature that makes the Catskills so majestic and our lives here in NY healthy and safe. 

Sincerely,
Laura Giles
