To whom this may concern:

As a New York City resident and second home owner in Chichester, NY in Ulster County, I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. Although I do support clean, renewable energy and the push to move away from fossil fuels, I do no think the plan by Premium Energy Holdings is the right way to enact this change and should not be approved by the Department of Energy.

The areas they have chosen in the Catskills are not only state protected forest lands, but also connect to the Ashokan Reservoir which supplies 93% of the usable water in New York City to its residents. Any tampering with this land and the streams that run into the Ashokan Reservoir could greatly impact the largest city in the United States. 

After Hurricane Irene, millions of dollars were spent in order to stabilize the land from erosion and turbidity in the areas that Premium Energy Holdings wants to disturb. This will not only affect local residents and New York City residents, but will greatly impact the wild life in these areas that is also protected by the state. 

It is my understanding that under the New York State Constitution that this proposal is in direction violation of using state protected lands for public or private gain.

Every year the Catskills brings in more and more tourists from around the state and the country for its natural beauty and also for the charming towns that exist in the area. Phoenicia is one of the most popular destinations in the Catskills along with its two ski resorts at Belleayre and Hunter. Any proposal to block off sections of these areas via construction on roads such as 214 would drastically inhibit the amount of travel in these areas which would be a huge strain on the local economy.

I ask that you take into consideration all of these reasons to oppose the preliminary permit for Premium Energy Holdings.

Sincerely,
Anne Kohlhagen
