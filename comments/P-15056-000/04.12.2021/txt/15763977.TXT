To:
Kimberly D. Bose
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First St. NE, Room 1A
Washington, D.C. 20426.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply 
flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings
to build a hydroelectric power plant in 
New Yorkâ€™s Catskill Mountains. 
I urge FERC to decline their request for 
Aza preliminary permit for the Ashokan 
Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it 
would be devastatingly harmful to the 
residents and the area.

I am sure you have received many comments 
indicating the following

Application is flawed and inaccurate in 
describing the project (not a closed loop 
system)

Bad for the area
Bad for the current residents
It is proposed to be built on protected land.
Increased turbidity and Will effect New York
City drinking water.

AN ITEM THAT YOU MUST BE CONCERNED WITH IS

THE POSSIBLE FAILURE OF THE PROPOSED DAM.

Just look in the recent news of failed man made dams.

Look at videos of the water volume during 
and post hurricanes in this area.

Normal spring thaw brings a large volume 
of water through the area.

The 100 and 500 year floods are more common.

Act wisely and deny this application now.
You do not want to regret your decision later.

Thank you for your time.
Aileen and Jeff Schwartz
