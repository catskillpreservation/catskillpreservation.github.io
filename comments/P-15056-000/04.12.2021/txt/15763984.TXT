My husband and I are avid hikers and naturalists in the Catskills and members of the Catskill 3500 club. While we support a move toward green energy, this alarming proposal is not the way forward.

1. All of the proposed locations are within the Catskill Forest Preserve, which is protected as “forever kept as wild forest lands” that should not “be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private” by the NYS Constitution. The forest around the proposed sites is among the top 1 percent of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

2. This proposal has substantial ecological trade-offs. In addition to claiming protect land, rapid fluctuations in water can wreak havoc on the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems overlap. Reservoirs produce methane: Hydropower Vision acknowledges that more research is needed on this issue. Additionally, pump storage is a net consumer of energy - pumping water up takes more power than it can make going back down.  

3. The proposal from Premium Energy Holdings contains inadequate information. There are vagaries in the proposal as to the type of pumped storage system being used (closed-loop vs open-loop). They seem to have done little preliminary research about the areas they’re proposing to develop, many of which are crucial homes to wildlife and are designated a Status 1 area by the USGS Gap Analysis Project.

There is a right way to do this. This is not that way. I am confident that a company earnestly working towards clean, renewable energy would be interested in partnering with community stakeholders toward a better, more sustainable, more efficient, and more responsible solution.
