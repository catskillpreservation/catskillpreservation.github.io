This project will negatively impact NYC drinking water and the quality of life throughout the town of Shandaken, for which I am a member of Planning Board.

The process of assessing project feasibility will place all home values and project developments in limbo for yours, stifling recovery of our tourist economy just when threat of COVID 19 appears to be lessening.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution as forever 'wild'. Most land in Shandaken is owned by NY State and the City of New York. This project will destroy long-standing communities.

It would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYCâ€™s drinking water.

It would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents.
