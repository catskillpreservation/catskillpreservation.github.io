Docket #P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose:

I am writing to voice my strong opposition to Premium Energy Holding's proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant int New York's Catskill Mountains.

The application is inaccurate many times over. Referring to the project as a “closed loop design” is ludicrous. The Esopus Creek runs into the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir would be looped into the proposed new reservoir. It is an “add-on” design with worse negative environmental impact.

The proposed site is located in the Catskill Forest Preserve. Article XIV of the NYS Constitution precludes implementation of this proposal. Premium Energy would have to succeed in passing a NYS constitutional amendment, requiring passage in both legislative houses and a sigh-off by the Governor. There would be no public support for this.

I am all for transitioning to green-energy sources. This is not the way to do it.

Thank you,
Thomas Parker
