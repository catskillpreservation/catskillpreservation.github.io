Proposed Woodland Reservoir  P-15056

In 1973 my family discovered Phoenicia, NY. My father Robert Marschall, built a vacation home on Fawn Hill Road. At that time, we were a family of 7; 2 parents and 5 teenage kids. We spend a lot of time in the area, taking advantage of all Ulster County has to offer: Belleayre Mountain Ski Area, Belleayre Lake, North Lake, hikes to Kaaterskill Falls, Fishing and Hunting, etc. We took advantage of great restaurants in Phoenicia such as Sweet Sues, The Sportsman and Alâ€™s. We contributed to the local economy at that time and we continue to contribute. Our family has now grown to 4 generations and over 30 people. The house is still there and it is used more than ever. During the pandemic almost everyone spent time there enjoying the wide-open spaces and again frequenting the newer establishments: The Phoenicia Diner, The Woodstock Brewing Company, Bread Alone Bakery, as well as the old established companies.
Knowing that Ulster County and specifically Phoenicia have shown incredible growth in tourism I would think this would not make it an ideal area to put the proposed Reservoir.
Through the 48 years that we have owned the house we have seen the economy of the area ebb and flow. Stores and Restaurants have open and then closed but in this past few year it has been up and remained up. Ulster County contributes a large portion to the tourism revenue and vacation home owners contribute millions of dollars to this percentage. 
Flooding an area of the Woodland Valley would not only have a Financial effect but also an Environmental effect on the area. This would have truly a negative effect on the Esopus Stream and the Fly-Fishing industry. 
There are countless negatives to this proposal that should put this area out of the running. 
Sincerely,
Ellen Helman
