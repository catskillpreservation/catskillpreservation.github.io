As a long time Ulster County resident and former Board Member of the Rondout-Esopus Land Conservancy, I want to voice my strong objection to the proposed Premium Energy project to build a reservoir in the Catskill mountains adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir.

This project proposes to expropriate people's dwellings, excavate trenches across private properties and disrupt a very peaceful, esthetic and deeply rural mountain community by shoehorning into it an industrial scale project.

Even the massive equipment's noises when operational will be a major intrusion into the environment, noxious alike to humans and animal life.

An additional negative feature of this proposed project is to tamper with water that is intended to be used as drinking water, unfiltered by permit, for the entire New York City metropolitan area. How many people will welcome drinking from water that has been used to spin turbines? Yuk!
