The above sould be a link to my comments that I hopefully copied and pasted.

I stand in objection to the proposed  project.  This is the CATSKILL PRESERVE.  Preserve means to keep and not alter as stated when the preserve was created.  Any site of the 3 proposed would be devastating to the people who live there, and to our community.  The creation of this project would also create turbidity in our Ashokan Reservoir.  The Ashokan Reservoir created the demise of a huge amount of property and many businesses when built.  This community has already given.  Each of these sites chosen are pristine works of nature.  This project would be a ruination.
I stand firmly against this California based potential project/ruination.
