Dear Ms Bose,  

I am writing in response to the very troubling proposal  by Premioum Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric plant in NYS Catskill Mountings.  I urge FERS to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashoka Pump Storage Project.  P15056 as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities and risky to the quality of NYC water..

Sincerely, 
Martha M Porter
