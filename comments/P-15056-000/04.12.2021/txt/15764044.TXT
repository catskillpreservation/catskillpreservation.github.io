To whom it may concern,

I urge you to decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage project. It is not that there is inherently a problem with hydroelectric plants as an alternative power source — to the contrary, we should be building more of them to help wean ourselves off fossil fuel-based power. BUT, the notion of building such a plant in such an environmentally sensitive and critical area like the Catskills Preserve is figuratively and literally (Article XIV in the NYS Constitution clearly protects the preserve from such decimation) criminal.

In addition, the affect on NYC’s water supply in the form of increased turbidity as a result of this proposed project is too much to risk.

Let’s find places where the environmental gains clearly outweigh the potential damage done by the construction of these plants, and then move forward with great speed, as our future depends on it. Unfortunately, the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage project does NOT meet that  critical criteria and would be a monumental disaster. 

It is with this in mind that I believe it is your duty to decline the requested permit.

Thank you for your time and I hope you and your agency make the prudent decision here.

Sincerely,

Jim Rich
