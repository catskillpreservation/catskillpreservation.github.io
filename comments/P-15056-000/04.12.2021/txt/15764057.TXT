As a resident of West Shokan, NY and Brooklyn, NY, I wholeheartedly agree with Ulster County Executive Pat Ryan in the county’s opposition to the proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  It provides us no benefit whatsoever to West Shokan, Ulster County or New York City. I also endorse NYC’s opposition to the proposed project on the basis of its danger to the clarity of the drinking water in New York City.  In addition, the Catskills are protected land, and therefore no projects such as this one proposed by Premium Energy Holdings should be approved. The disruption to neighborhoods and the environment would be profound. To invoke eminent domain would be catastrophic, tantamount to stealing land for profit. This project must not go forward.
