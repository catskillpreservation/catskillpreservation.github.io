I believe the preliminary permit application for the ashokan pumped storage project should be denied.
"I go the woods to lose my mind and find my soul."
this project makes no sense financially, environmentally or ethically.
It would effect millions of people's drinking water 
Please do not entertain the thought of building this project!
