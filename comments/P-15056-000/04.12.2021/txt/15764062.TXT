We wish to register a strong protest against the proposed “PSH” hydro-electric project by Premium Energy Holdings for this area.  Such a project would hugely disrupt and damage the protected forest, water, flora and animal species in this area, as well as add electrical pollution in the form of high voltage transmission towers planned to run through our very backyard.  High voltage towers have been proven to cause leukemia and other negative health effects on humans and animals. The extensive digging and tunneling required will also do immense damage to the reservoir water quality, our towns, and these parklands meant to be forever wild.  We moved to West Shokan in 1982 confident that the Catskill Park was an area legally protected from development and pollution by the NYS Constitution.
