I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains.  It would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities (some of which have suffered eminent domain previously to make the Ashokan Reservoir), and pose a risk to NYC’s drinking water. 

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects are important in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the Catskill Forest Preserve (700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat) must not be sacrificed in the process.  Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation-one where the construction and operation will destroy protected wilderness, displace communities and threaten important natural resources.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Sita Anderson
