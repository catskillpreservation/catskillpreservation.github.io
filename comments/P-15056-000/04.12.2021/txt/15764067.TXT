For three generations, my family has made a home in Woodland Valley during the summer months. In particular, my parents bought a family cabin in 1968; they passed it on to me and my siblings, and I hope to pass it on to my children, and that they will be able to pass it on to their own children in years to come. 

Additionally, since 1968, my family and I have paid taxes, supported local businesses, helped safeguard the ecology, and enjoyed being productive, participatory members of the Woodland Valley area. Since 1968, My family has stocked the Woodland Valley stream, brought extended friends and family to the region to spend money, and create beautiful traditions that are essential to the our family’s happiness.

Not only will this proposed Project destroy entire ecological systems and my family’s summer traditions, but the ripple effects of this project will certainly harm local businesses when thousands of residents – both summer and year-round – are displaced.

In fact, the transfer of reserve land to a private party must be done by a constitutional amendment. So, the plan appears that this project is both I’ll-advised and illegal.

For these reasons, I object in the strongest possible terms to this project and the devastating effect it will have on the local community, it’s business ecology, and recreation.
