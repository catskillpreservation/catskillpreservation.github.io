The effects of dams have a long history of harming the environment. While dams do provide renewable energy, this does not outweigh the direct effects of dams on the environment surrounding them. This will be putting peopleâ€™s property underwater and contaminate habitats of animals in the area. This dam should not be built, please consider how this is affecting the community.
