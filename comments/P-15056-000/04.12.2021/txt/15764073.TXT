I write this letter strongly opposing the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project being submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC. There are numerous reasons why this proposed project should not be considered and be dropped immediately. I'll point out a few that stand out to me most. #1 The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. Hundreds of precious acres would be effected by this ridiculous project. Imagine what it would do the wildlife and fauna that rely on this region? #2 This project would be detrimental to our local communities by disrupting our economy and displacing residents. I personally own several businesses in the area and can tell you from first hand experience that COVID was brutal to small businesses. In fact, I was forced to close one of them. Let's not have Premium Energy Holdings,LLC create another economic fiasco for our region. #3 Lastly, the power lines for this project are proposed to cut right through my property which is a historic 1720 homestead built by dutch settlers. I don't think the founders would have ever imagined huge electric lines cutting right through their property and over their house. I also don't think that any owner of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC would allow this to ever happen on their gorgeous historic property. I can tell you that I sure the hell don't want this to ever happen on mine. This ridiculous proposal must be stopped now and not go any further!!!
