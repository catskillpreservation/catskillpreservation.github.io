RE: Docket #: P-15056-000

     After much reading and sharing on the topic of a hydro plant being built near the Ashokan Reservoir I find that I CANNOT accept this project.  I understand the issues at hand, and realize that it is important for New York state to have high renewable energy goals, but the Catskills are deemed Status 1 land and the Department of Energy states that Satus 1 & 2 lands should not be developed.  This project would create havoc and destroy the beauty of this awe-inspiring region.
     Also, in my reading it stated that water would have to be pumped uphill in order for it to then flow downhill; very sisyphean. It just does not make sense to ruin land, change the landscape, and build new tunnels in an area so protected.
     I object to the proposal of a hydro plant at the Ashokan Reservoir and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission DENY Premium Energy Holdings application for a preliminary permit.
      Very truly yours,  Doreen Arnesen
