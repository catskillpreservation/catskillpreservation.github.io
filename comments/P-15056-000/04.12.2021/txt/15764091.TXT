I am writing in opposition to building a pumped storage hydro plant in the Catskills. The proposed project impacts some highly protected areas of the Catskills and affects wildlife habitats of multiple protected species in all three potential development areas. All three areas impact highly preserved lands and stream ecologies. All three are trout breeding waters. All three are within Audubon’s Catskills Peaks Important Bird Areas. All are habitats for some plant, bird, bat and snake species on NY’s “threatened”, “special concern”, or “greatest conservation need” lists including the bog orchid, northern long-eared bat, scarlet tanager, wood thrush, black-throated blue warbler, and three hawk species.
Although NY State needs to consider green energy alternatives, this project is not the kind of innovation the state seeks. The Catskills and the NYC watershed are not the areas for a pumped storage hydro project. 

There has to be a better use of NY tax payer dollars than rerouting streams and roads, and disrupting the delicate ecosystem in the Catskills. Not to mention the damage this project would do to the local community drinking water.

Please consider other options and do not move forward with this project.
