I’m writing in reference to docket P=15056.
The Catskills are a great area. Some of the views remain spectacular and visiting remains a humbling experience. Although development and continued encroachment are likely inevitable, where we can, we should try to limit growth and destructive development. The proposal to build a dam, a reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline and powerlines falls into this category. This development would remove access to popular hiking destinations and limit already stressed resources available for recreation. Vistas will be destroyed and ecosystems irreparably damaged. The outdoor industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and this area of New York would see a reduction in tourist dollars and business revenue. We need to do the right thing which is limit development, don’t allow development of a new hydroelectric facility and preserve land for future generations.
Thanks,
Ken Lipnickey
