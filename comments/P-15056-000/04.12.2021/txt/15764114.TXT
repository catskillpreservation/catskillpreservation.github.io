I live in Ulster County and I walk, ski and bike regularly on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. 
This area is part of the Catskill Park and Forest Preserve and is constitutionally protected (much of it as Forever Wild lands) by New York State. The Ashokan Reservoir is part of the largest unfiltered drinking water system in the world, with gravity-fed water provided to New York City. This area and its scenic beauty are economically important to many people here - tourists come from all over the world to see the beauty of the Catskills and tourism is a major part of our local economy. 
I object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. 
In addition, the project will affect both local and tourist enjoyment of these protected lands, damaging our local economy. Two major walking and biking paths are on either side of the Ashokan Reservoir, used by many thousands of visitors in every season. Damage to this area would have a pronounced negative effect on local businesses of all types.
Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
Thank you for your attention -
