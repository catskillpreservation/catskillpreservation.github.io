RE:  Ashokan Pump Storage Facility in The Catskills

I would like to VOTE NO ON THIS PROJECT.

Reasons:

Premium is lying on the type of method they are using ('closed loop') and plan a method more destructive.

Premium has a bad record on projects they have worked on in California.

Existing park lands, and forest will be destroyed for this project.

The water source into New York City (40% Ashoken, 90% total reservoir complex) may become turbid and     undrinkable by the residents of New York City.

Alternative solutions for energy resources for the area have not been researched - especially in wind and solar power.

The project itself was announced in February without adequate time to do this research.

The rush to do this project, which would destroy so much, affect so many millions of people, possibly forever, by an incompetent company must be halted.
