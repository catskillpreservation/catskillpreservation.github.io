I am writing in regards to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage project.  This proposal seems vague at best and in researching I canâ€™t find any information on how it will benefit our community.  We are all very concerned about the negative impact such a 3-5 year undertaking will have on our environment, our wildlife and our beautiful Catskill Mountains not to mention tourism which accounts for a large part of the area business income.

In other words there are many negatives to this plan, and to date not one obvious positive.

To sum up, I and everyone I have spoken to regarding this endeavor, are 100% against it.
