As an active member in the Hunter Valley Community I have grave concerns about the proposed hydroelectric power plant. There is absolutely no benefit to the Catskills mountains nor the people who reside there. In fact, there are only costly detriments to the protected wildlife in the region and forced evictions for the thousands of residents in the proposed flood plane. Itâ€™s my understanding that this proposal would require rerouting Rt 214. Absurd, impossible and frankly irresponsible. Route 214 is the main access road to the mountain areas where millions of dollars a year are spent on tourism, skiing and lodging, and wildlife activities. The cost of changing the location of route 214 should be an immediate deterrent. The flood plane effectively cuts off thousands of residents from the southern New York State. The damage to the water table will take decades to recover. The environment impact of dams is scientifically proven to disproportionately harm the ecosystem. The energy produced from this plant is not even close to outweighing the negative impact it will have on the freshwater table nor the list of protected wildlife that lives in the area. 

I will be extremely vocal on social media informing the public on how terrible this proposal truly is.
