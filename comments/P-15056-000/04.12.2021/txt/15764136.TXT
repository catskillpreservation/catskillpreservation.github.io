I am not sure where to start, the lack of community input or comment before a company in California announced they would build a hydroelectric plant requiring a holding pond. Or that this holding pond (Pond should be in quotes obviously as this is no pond) will destroy countless homes. We are already a community who has been decimated by these projects in the past, and while I don't oppose NYC DEP, we do not/ cannot have more homes taken in such a fashion. 

I could list more reasons, but the most important reason of all is to say that I a citizen of Delaware County in the Catskills am angered and upset by this and opposed to it.

NYC already operated hydroelectric projects on its water supply dams and I applaud this. Premium Energy is applying to build a disruptive system that will destroy towns and communities. We as a region have already sacrificed lands to serve others, to serve the NYC watershed and asking for more sacrifices is criminal.
