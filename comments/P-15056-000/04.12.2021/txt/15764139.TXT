Dear Kimberly D. Bose/FERC

I  was recently shocked to learn of the preliminary efforts of Premium Energy Holdings to build a pumped storage hydro project at the top of Moon Haw Road in West Shokan. Or, to put it more accurately, to obliterate this wonderful area by drowning it under several hundred feet of water. I have been a  professional photographer for the last fifty years and have been a regular contributor to such publications as Audubon, and National Wildlife as well as the author of over a dozen books of my photographs, with a special interest in the interaction of man and the landscape. Sometimes the interaction is benign, but much more often, as in this case, it is irreparably harmful. 

I do not live in the Catskills, but I have photographed there over the years. I know MoonHaw Road and the beauty of the surrounding mountains and forests well, especially along the Wittenberg Brook, where my step-daughter and son-in-law live. Because this spot is not one of the must-see tourist destinations of the region like Kaaterskill Falls, it has escaped the overuse of too many hikers (not to mention the careless selfie fanatic occasionally plunging to their demise.) It remains an unspoiled and beautiful gem, and should be protected, not destroyed!

If the surrounding mountains and the forests along the banks of Wittenberg Brook are designated by law as: "forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private." I don't understand how this is even under consideration. Obviously, this developer's motivation is not altruism or a passion for green energy, but money. I strongly urge you and your committee to put an end to this proposal at the outset and not allow this preliminary permit to go forward.

Thank you,

Richard W. Brown
