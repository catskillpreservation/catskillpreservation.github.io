I am against the proposal to build a Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant within the Catskill Park. The Catskill Preserve is one of the great public lands in the United States. Preserved in the Constitution of the State of New York to be forever wild. Building this plant could destroy what makes the Park so beautiful to all New Yorkers. I believe that changes to ant land management would have to be done through a New York State constitutional amendment and no other way.
