Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the erroneous proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains.

Although pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will be vital to the transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process.

The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. Destroying this sacred and preserved land for this project is a travesty, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country. Alternative and more appropriate sites must be instead considered.

In addition, The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

The proposed plan would be devastating to the environment. Therefore FERC must decline Premium Energy’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Melanie Kier
