Hi, there,

I'm writing to urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. The impact on the environment of the Constitutionally protected Catskills land would be brutal, as would the impact on the people who live there, whose homes would be seized via eminent domain. The land is considered status 1 land according to USGS Gap Analysis and should be protected from development. I'm sure people more articulate than me have made these points in greater depth, but I wanted to take a moment to add my voice. Thanks!
