Dear Friends,

I just heard about the organization, Save the Catskill Preserve from my father. Their call to action is to stop “Premium Energy” from building unnecessary dams and flooding hundreds of acres of wilderness protected by the New York State Constitution in perpetuity.  As an avid hiker, fisherman, camper, and rock climber of the Catskills and a long-standing resident of Ulster County, I believe this is a very important cause. I believe it would be a travesty to flood these ancient forests and deprive my children and their children’s children the ability to enjoy these sacred lands. Please lend your voice to help protect such a huge part of Ulster County’s Legacy. 

Best Regards,

Benjamin Fredrick Franklin Hellman
