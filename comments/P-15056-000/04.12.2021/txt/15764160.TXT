Dear Ms. Bose,
As an avid birdwatcher and nature enthusiast I am aware of the potential damage the project being considered can do to bird populations as well as fish populations.  The Catskill area is known for it trout fishing, dark night skies with less light pollution than the surrounding areas, poetic vistas for artists, and wild life hiking trails open to all to explore.  

Herons, eagles, osprey, and many other birds, depend on healthy river systems for food and shelter. They make their nests in and along the  banks of Esopus.  It's taken decades for the Eagles to return to our area, it's been mainly in the last 10-15 years they have increased in numbers.  The hydroelectric dam and storage area will prevent the natural highs and lows of the stream, changing the patterns of migration for trout, that are a huge draw for tourists in our area.  This project can also reduce the breeding ground of migratory fish—a key food source for eagles, osprey—and cloud the waters, making it harder for these birds to spot their prey.  
I strongly request you seek to protect the wild life of our esteemed area.                                            Respectively,                                                               Madeline Mallon RN.
