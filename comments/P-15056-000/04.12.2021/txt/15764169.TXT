I am writing in opposition to this project. It will encroach on NY State Constitutionally protected lands in the Catskill Park. 

Those lands are revered by New Yorkers and by many others from around  the USA and around the world. 

Also, this project will inundate hundreds or thousands of acres in an ecologically sensitive region. Habitat destruction, interference with wildlife, and destruction of human communities and businesses will all result from this ill-conceived proposal should it come to fruition. 

In addition, the creation of additional electricity supply is a wrong-headed response to the need to reduce fossil fuel usage. Alternative efforts such as increased conservation and efficiency would be better solutions.

FInally, the net gain in supply will not be as great as many believe, since the creation of the power from the project requires the use of electrical power in order to accomplish its aim. The chief gain would be for the owners of the project, rather than to the residents of the affected communities.

For these reasons and more, this project should be rejected before it gets under way.

Yours truly,
Dr. Wayne Ouderkirk
