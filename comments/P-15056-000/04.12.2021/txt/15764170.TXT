I am writing to object to the hydro-electric dam building project, docket P-15056.  I have been visiting the Woodland Valley Campground and hiking area for over 6 years.  I love this area.  This land should continue to be preserved as per article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  If we don't honor this article it will only lead to other businesses doing the same.  The article should not be broken for any reason.
I travel to this area several times a year for hiking, camping, and fishing.  Then, I stay at the town of Phoenicia where me and my friends often stop at the Phoenicia Diner.  Without this land and the draw of the preserved wilderness, I would search out other places that offer a unique combination of food, culture, and outdoors.

Thank you.
