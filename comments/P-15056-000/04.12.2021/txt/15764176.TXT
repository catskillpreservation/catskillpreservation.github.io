	I join the myriad number of people who say NO to the application.

	The surreptitiously (acting in a stealthy way) presented, insidious (intended to enrage or beguile) application has already caused great harm to many people who are seriously suffering from the Covid 19 pandemic and its effects, and questioning every aspect of their future.

	This added burden is unacceptable!

	We live our lives in the Catskills as conservators of precious resources â€”- from the purest water for a city with millions of people to an unmatched environment of natural beauty for renewal of sprit and health.

	Please do the right thing and reject this entire application that is before you!
