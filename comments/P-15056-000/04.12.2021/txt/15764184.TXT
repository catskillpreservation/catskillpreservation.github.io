I am writing in opposition to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains.  

The proposal to situate this hydroelectric plant in the Catskill Mountains shows a disrespect and lack of basic understanding of this area's history, and its environmental and tourism history and future.  

The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County, and consists of a continuous wildlife habitat of around 700,000 acres.  This pristine forest ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.   As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”  According to Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

Not only is this land protected, it provides essential tourism through access to wilderness hiking and fishing, among other activities. The Catskills have seen an exponential growth of users in recent years, and offer the only regional opportunity for this type of recreation on continuous land.  By taking away area to build the proposed hydroelectric plant, more users will be forced onto already crowded trails, increasing the negative environmental impact on this pristine wilderness.  

I strongly urge you to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Cheyenne Mallo
