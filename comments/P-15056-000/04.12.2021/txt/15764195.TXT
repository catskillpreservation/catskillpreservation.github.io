Hi there,

I'm a Catskills region resident who is adamantly against this proposal for so many reasons:

-The detrimental effects on our region.
-The potential harm to our drinking water.
-The ways that a non-local organization is proposing to invade our region for their own private profit. 
-The people it would displace.

This is a protected area. Could a citizen propose such an absurd development? 

There are lots of ways to harness green energy in this region that do not involve such a massive, destructive undertaking.

Who does this proposal really benefit?

Not us.  

Do not allow or consider this proposal.
