  My name is Carsten Warnes.  I reside at 4265 Route 28A, West Shokan, NY 12494.  I am writing in opposition to the Premium Energy Proposal P-15056:000. The Catskill Forest Preserve is supposed to be "forever wild". It was created for that exact purpose in 1885 in Ulster County.  The language in Article XIV of the New York State Constitution states that the land shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.  The idea was to guard and conserve the land in world that is increasingly fragmented.  The Preserve consists of 700,000 acres of contiuous wildlife habitat.  The habitat contains both birds and fish that will be endangered by the project.  All three reservoirs fall within the Audubon's Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area.  The Catskill Forest Preserve are considered Status 1 lands under USGS "GAP Analysis Program".  The Department of Energy has stated that lands with this designation cannot be considered for projects.
   Premier Energy says their project is a closed loop.  It is not, but rather is an add-on project which is not what the Department of Energy is looking for in the way of innovation.
