Hi. I’m Zeke, an 11-year-old from Acton, Massachusetts. Before I can remember, I’ve always had a summer home, where I went with all my family, in Chichester, NY. It is a place that brings joy to me, and a place where so many memories were made. Since the world shut down because of COVID-19, I have been thinking about Chichester a lot. Thinking back on everything that happened and thinking about what we’ll do in there once the world is out of quarantine. When I heard the news that your company was going to use the land that our house in Chichester, as well as so many others, as building grounds for a hydroelectric plant, I was upset. So I’m saying this, on behalf of everybody living and working on the ground where you’re going to build the plant, please, don’t. That place is a lifeline for me, so please don’t cut it.

Sincerely,
Zeke
