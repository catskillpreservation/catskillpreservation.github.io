Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose or other interested party,

I am writing to strongly object to proposed Project P-15056 in the Catskill Mountains of NY.

I live in an area which would be dramatically impacted by this project, particularly if the "Woodland" proposed site is adopted. As far as I can tell, the project will have substantial negative impacts on the local environment and New York City's water supply infrastructure. However, I most wanted to emphasize that it would be devastating to my century-old nearby community. It's hard to tell from the maps, but the project would almost certainly involve the destruction of critical roads, the displacement of houses, and the despoiling of much of the well-loved surrounding natural beauty.

Please reject Premium Energy's request for a preliminary permit. (!)

Sincerely,
Simon Berring
