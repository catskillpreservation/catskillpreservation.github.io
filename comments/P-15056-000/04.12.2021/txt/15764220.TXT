As a resident and voting citizen of Olive NY I hereby register my strong protest to the proposed project: Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. The unforeseen environmental and economic impact on both current residents and tourists is too big to risk.

Our local area is protected and beautiful land, and of course a tourist attraction. This project could have a potentially devastating impact on the natural ecosystem and thus could have a negative economic impact on our tourist industry. This project is to be avoided at all costs. There are other sources of renewable energy now available that must be urgently considered like solar and wind energy. 

As residents, we vow to organize community locally, at state and federal level if we need to in order to block this proposal. Thank you for your consideration, we look forward to thanking you for your denial of this project.
