I am a home owner in the area adjacent to the proposed underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir. I am 100% for clean renewable energy. However, this project proposal does not benefit the town and more importantly the ecology and environmental benefits. Therefore i strongly oppose this proposed project from Premium Energy Holdings.

This project involves digging into valleys in the towns of Olive or Shandaken and damming streams to create reservoirs as part of “pumped storage” for electricity to be generated using associated water transport tunnels. Tapping into any energy generated would require a massive new high power electric transmission network. New York needs clean energy, but this is not the way to go.

This construction adjacent to the drinking water reservoir not only affects the immediate community but also may disrupt a critical drinking water supply for nine million people.
