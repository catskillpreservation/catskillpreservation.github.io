I am writing to oppose the granting of the permit for a preliminary study by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC.  I oppose this application for a number of reasons: 

1.  This study is planned in the Catskill preserve, which is a state-protected "forever wild" area of half a million acres of land.  This project would completely disrupt the sensitive wetlands, wildlife, and ecological balance here. It would clearly destroy habitat for numerous species, some of which are protected and endangered. 

2.  This California-based company seems to know nothing about our actual town (The Town of Olive, NY), referring to it as "Shokan City" and implying that no one lives here.  In reality, the location of their possible above- and underground project is home to many people who would be displaced.  As an added note, a large section of this town was already displaced to construct the Ashokan Reservoir. 

3.  The Ashokan Reservoir provides water to New York City, which carefully maintains the lands around the reservoir to keep the water pollution-free and as undisturbed as possible.  It seems obvious that this plan would increase turbidity and upset the delicate balance maintained by the City of New York. 

4.  This seems a worthy project but this is the wrong location.  It should be sited where it does not endanger humans, wildlife, forests, and thedrinking water of 10 million people.  

Thank you, 
Bruce Katz
