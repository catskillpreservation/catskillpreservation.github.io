This response is in regards to docket number P-15056-000. The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage project in the Town of Olive should be rejected due to the inherent disruption to the local ecosystem and because it necessitates the displacement of local residents. 

As a solar energy developer, I fully believe renewable energy projects should be embraced, but not at the expense of local communities. Less invasive projects should be explored that do not pose a threat to lifelong residents and their way of life. Preserving the Town of Olive and the greater Catskill Park in which it resides should be of utmost priority. 

And so I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit.
