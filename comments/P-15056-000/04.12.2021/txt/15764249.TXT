I write in reference to docket number P-15056-000.

Living in Olive for the past 35 years, with a near panoramic view of the magnificent Ashokan Reservoir, I find the proposal by the Premium Energy Holdings company uniquely disturbing. What I have always cherished most about our area is the relationship between nature, the environment and the need to service the essentials of the local population; all existing in a fine balance. This proposal seems outrageously out off whack and self serving and I believe it would alter the nature of this Catskill area irremediably. I can't but see, in my mind's eye, the figure of Smokey the Bear with that tear in his eye. It seems as though a multitude of concerned people are raising their voices as Smokey did, with “Only YOU can prevent this travesty”. We do hope you will reject such an ill conceived plan.
