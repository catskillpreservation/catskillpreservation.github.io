My name is Yochanan Kushnir. I am a resident of the Town of Olive. My address is 161 Black Road, in Shokan. I am writing to express my objection to the FERC project and sub-docket number P-15056:000: the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

I am a climate scientist, a professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia Univeristy. I am extremely concerned about the impact of climate change and wholly support the transition to renewable, clean energy. I was delighted that the State of New York adopted its Clean Energy Standard plan in 2015. However, I was extremely concerned when I found out about this Pumped Storage project. Cutting down forest and clearing out land to dig a reservoir will have huge negative environmental consequences in the highly preserved, New York State Catskill Forest, its precious streams and rare wildlife. Forest fragmentation is an often neglected issue that affects availability of clean water and air as well as effective, natural Carbon Dioxide sequestration. It affects wildlife mobility and survival on land and in the streams. And this particular project seems to me as threatening the safe functioning of the Ashokan Reservoir by increasing likelihood for high turbidity events. I resided in the past in New York City and appreciated the quality of water coming down from the Catskills. The proposed project will damage this quality.

I understand that Pumped Storage plants have been put to successful use in the US and that they are a clean backup option to wind and solar power plants. I also understand however, that building a Pumped Storage plant is a costly endeavor and is not an efficient solution (it consumes more energy than it delivers). In this case the project has particularly negative, site-specific, environmental and ecological impacts. I therefore register my objection to this project.
