I oppose this project, because this area houses a vibrant community with many peopleâ€™s homes and local businesses. The lives of people and wildlife depend on this area, it would be a shame to have it damaged by a project like this. Not to mention the effect of the construction process and the dams and pumps on the NYC drinking water.
