My name is Dina Kushnir, I live I the town of Olive and my address is 161 Black Rd Shokan. 
I am writing about NY FERC project and sub-docket numbered: P-15056:000. 
I am a nature lover and hiker and enjoy the many hiking trails in the Catskill Mountains. I moved to this area for the beauty and tranquility. This land is a NY State Park and preserved for its mountains, forest and wild life. My most concern with this project is the impact and harm to the wild life, forests and animals. The environmental destructions of forests and mountains will destroy their species habitats. It either pushes them towards human habitats, like the bears who roam this area and become dangerous to human, or destroys countless smaller animals’ life spaces and even brings some species to the brink of extinction. Ecosystems are the result of thousands and of years of development and homeostasis. Nature works to maintain balance with endless correcting and balancing timeless acts. When a major destruction like this project is forced on the environment in few months’ time, more or less, the environmental impact is far reaching and can take decades to repair. This is only one negative aspect of the intended project and the impact is far reaching to human too. This is why I register my objection to this project. 

Cordially, Dina
