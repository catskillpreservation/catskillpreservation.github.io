As a local and resident having grown up in the Catskills and Hudson valley and now as a landowner and full time resident of the area, I find the plans for the dam and power generation plant a massive oversight of what we residents will value and support. I do not support the plans and believe the proposal should be struck down. I own property in both Saugerties and New Paltz and frequently enjoy the Catskill Park and all it has to offer. The plans for the dam diminish value and negatively impact an area I care deeply about and have invested my life in. Please stop the dam from being built.
