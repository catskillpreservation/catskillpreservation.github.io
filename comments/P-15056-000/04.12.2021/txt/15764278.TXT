To whom it may concern,

I'm writing to express my concern and opposition against the Premium Energy Holdings, LLCâ€™s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. 

I feel the project is wildly inappropriate and irresponsible given all the negative and harmful impacts it will have on drinking water, watershed, and the displacement of residents and wildlife inhabitants. The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and it would be a disaster to harm this land and its inhabitants.  I urge you to not allow this project to advance.

Regards,
Jamie
