Dear Ms. Bose,

I’m writing as a deeply concerned citizen and property owner in the Catskills region regarding the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant. I believe it is important to consider transitional solutions to renewable energy but this is a terribly executed proposal, and would cause great harm to one of the most pristine and ‘protected’ environments ¬– streams, the Catskill forest preserve, its wildlife – in the country. Article XIV of the New York State constitution guarantees these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
It would have a negative impact on New York City’s drinking water by the increased turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed, displace the residents and their livelihood; the disruption to the economy as tourism is a major part of the state’s economy and particularly so in this region.

Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, a $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs, Ulster County represents 43% of that market, and second homes generate $360 million in economic activity. 

This is not a project the community, adjacent communities, or New York State wants in this region.  We urge you to reject approval for the preliminary permit Premium Energy Holdings is seeking – the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Janet Robinson
