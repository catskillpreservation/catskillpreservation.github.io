To the FERC team - 

As a resident of Olivebridge, NY, I am writing to oppose Premium Energy Holdings, LLC’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (FERC project number, P-15056). I am writing in the hopes that the initial permit application by Premium Energy Holdings will be denied, rather than allowing any further progress to the project. 

It is my understanding that New York City Dept of Environmental Protection, a city agency that I have worked with in the past and whose work I hold in high scientific regard, is not supporting this project. Their research into the project calls into attention serious issues with gaps and quality of the application, viability for the project's realization, and issues with the environmental impacts of the project. I stand behind this analysis and respectfully request that the project permit be denied. 

Other environmental groups have also raised series and significant issues with the application by Premium Energy Holdings. Among others, these include the likely impacts on highly preserved land: 
- under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
- The Preserve is 700,000 acres of contiguous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 
- Of serious note: as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum 
- Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats ▪ Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the NYC water supply

While I am strongly in favor of renewable energy projects, and have supported many other projects around NY State, this is one project I cannot support. I strongly urge you to heed the analysis and requests of NYC DEP to stop the project from continuing. There must be other, less impactful possible locations for renewable energy projects.  

Thank you,
Chris Aston
