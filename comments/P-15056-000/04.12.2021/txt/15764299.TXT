Comment in OPPOSITION to Proposed Project

My name is Mark, a senior mechanical engineering student at the University of Delaware with a minor in sustainable energy technology. As a frequent resident to the Catskills of New York and a student of sustainable energy this project caught my attention.  Sustainable energy is great, but one of the key limitations is location.  For a project to go through the location must be adequate, both in terms of the technological advantages as well as the political/social impact.  In my studies at University, I held an internship position at a solar energy company.  My primary responsibility was to evaluate project sites both for the advantages to solar as well as things such as endangered/protected species or land. This was a preliminary screening for a project site. If it interfered with any protected habitats, endangered species or historical sites, the site was out of the question.  The three proposed projects for the pumped storage hydro plant all interfere with New York States Forest Preserve, in which the goal for this Preserve is to keep the lands “forever wild.” Building a pumped storage within these lands will directly affect the biodiversity of the area by displacing various animals and plants.  All in all, I support the state of New York for looking into renewable energy sources. However, the proposed locations for the hydro plant directly violate the goals and values put forth by the Forest Preserve. I will not consent or abide to this proposal by Premium Energy.

Sincerely,
Mark Marschall
