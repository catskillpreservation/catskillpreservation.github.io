As a lifelong NYS resident born and raised in Ulster County, the proposed site of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, I want to register my great concern over the concept and scope of this project and its potential dramatic impact on this Catskill Mountain region and its communities.  Based upon my review of the project as currently proposed, there appears to be a high risk for negative consequences on this fragile and beautiful ecosystem which includes the Esopus Creek fishery and its tributaries as well as vast areas of protected wilderness.  Certainly, less impactful options need to be considered before this proposal receives even preliminary consideration given the potential impact.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal.
