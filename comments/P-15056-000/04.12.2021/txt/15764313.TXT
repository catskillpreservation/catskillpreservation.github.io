My parents live and own property directly in the area that will be affected by this project. I am very concerned with the impact of this plan, both on the area and on the drinking water in NYC. Environmental impact: the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NYS constitution. Economic impact: $300 million, or more, of spending by tourists in the Catskills would be impacted, if not destroyed. The drinking water of people who live in Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan or Staten Island, would be negatively impacted by the project. Premium Energy’s application has mistakes and inaccuracies. Key players weren’t contacted (Ulster, Greene Counties, Shandaken, Olive and Hunter towns, NYC, DEP, etc.)
