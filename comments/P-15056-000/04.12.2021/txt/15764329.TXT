I stand with the Catskill Mountain Club in opposing this proposal. It is obvious that the applicants have no knowledge or understanding of the meaning of the Catskill Park, America's First Wilderness. The Catskill Park deserves to be preserved, as do the lives and livelihoods of those who reside there. This project honors neither. 
  The Premium Energy project would cause permanent and irreparable harm, and, therefore, it must be rejected.
