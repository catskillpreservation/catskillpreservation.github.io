To whom it may concern 

As a resident of the catskills and only 10 minutes drive from the proposed project location I would like to express my serious concerns.
The area has a beautifully functioning eco system, that holds a balance in nature. 
There are very few manmade constructs that arenâ€™t disruptive to nature and this particular one would have a huge negative impact on everything living in its vicinity with a questionable attempt towards renewable energy. The impact is just not worth the outcome. This project seems to only have the economical gain of the investors in mind and not of the local community.
I strongly hope that we will make a wise decision in favor of keeping the catskills safe from such invasive projects and companies and will vote against this dam project

Sincerely 
Sylvia
