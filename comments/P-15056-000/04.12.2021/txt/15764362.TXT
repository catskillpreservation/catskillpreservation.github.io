To whom it may concern, 
Like so many others, I was astounded to hear of FERC's consideration of Premium Energy Holdings hydroelectric power plant proposal in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

This should not even be granted a feasibility study given that: 
1) This is State Forest Preserve, and under ArIcle XIV of the NYS ConsItuIon, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.

2) These lands are home to a diverse and rich habitat, which supports myriad species of fish, birds mammals, etc.,,,, one which is beloved by all, AS IS.

3) Aside from potential local issues, this project could potentially harm NYC's drinking supply, which is one of the city's greatest assets. That particular part, of playing games with the reservoir which dependably supplies NYC with [I believe] 40% of it's daily drinking water is particularly surprising to me.

I hope FERC will make the right decision, and reject this feasibility study outright.
I thank you for your consideration.
