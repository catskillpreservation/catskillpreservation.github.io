Hello,

As residents of Shokan, NY, we vigorously object to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to place a hydro-electric plant near the Ashokan Reservoir. We request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny the application for a preliminary permit. This project is NOT a closed-loop project so should not be considered. Also, the Catskill Forest Preserve is a State Forest Preserve, protected by the NY constitution, and is considered Status 1 land under USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the Dept of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “Areas with form protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

This project will most definitely be detrimental to the area wildlife and to valuable drinking water for NYC and NY state. This project should not be considered and should not move forward in any shape or form.

Thank you,
Kristal Kinder-Bartlett & James Bartlett
