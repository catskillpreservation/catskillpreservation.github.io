RE: Docket # P-15056 Ashokan Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Proposal
 
Dear Secretary Bose:

I am writing to express my opposition to the pumped storage hydroelectric generation project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings for the Catskill Park region of  New York. (FERC Docket #P-15056).
 
The whole proposal is erroneously described as a “closed loop system,” when in fact it is anything but a closed loop. It should at best be described as an “add on” system.
 
Building any one of the proposed upper reservoirs would displace hundreds of local residents, destroy wild trout spawning tributaries and, according to experts, destabilize the streams that are dammed. This  destabilization would cause more turbid waters to be delivered to the Ashokan Reservoir, which is also acting as the lower reservoir for the Power Project. Moving water back and forth between the upper reservoir and the Ashokan would also likely create more turbidity.

The final nail in this coffin should be the fact that the Ashokan Reservoir provides unfiltered drinking water to over 9 million people in New York City and other communities along the way! Risking this much pure drinking water over some half-baked pumped storage power plan.

Premium Energy Holdings should be denied any permits to do any further studies on this proposal.

Sincerely,

Lindsay Hoyt
Treasurer
Ashokan-Pepacton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited
