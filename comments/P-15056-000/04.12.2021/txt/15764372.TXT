Dear Ms. Bose,

I am tremendously concerned about the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, that proposes to flood over 200 acres of private land and protected state forests to construct a new reservoir. 

We should not forget that the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The wildlife in the area will be endangered. 

This project would also be detrimental to the local community by disrupting the economy, thriving tourism, and displacing residents. 

Moreover, it would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYCâ€™s drinking water (as it serves as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for over 9 million New York residents). 

Another concern is that it will severely disrupt existing regional wells and septic systems which in turn will negatively affect the quality of water regionally and in New York City.  

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, and negatively impact the drinking water of over 9 million New Yorkers.
