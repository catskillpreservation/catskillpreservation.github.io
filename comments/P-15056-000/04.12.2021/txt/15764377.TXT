		Re:	Project No. 15056-000
			Premium Energy Holdings, LLC

Dear Commissions:

	This preliminary permit should be denied. The land that the preliminary permit appears to be utilizing is “The lands enclosed within the proposed project boundary are New York State Lands”. (See Application Section 5 at page 13). This land while owned by New York State is shown as wilderness or forest. (See Application Exhibit 3). This land, as I understand, is designated by New York State as “Forever Wild”. Such designation is given by the New York State Constitution and it cannot be utilized for the purposes of a Hydroelectric Power. As I and many others understand, this land cannot be sold or leased or licensed for use and cannot be built on in any form and must be left as forest and wilderness. It would literally take the President of the United States and an act of Congress to condemn by eminent domain this land. 

	With the above being said, your standard of denying an application is stated succinctly in  footnote 2 in opinion 170 FERC ¶ 61,231, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION application of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Project No. 14991-001 when you state as follows:

§ 1133(c), (d)(4) (prohibiting the Commission from licensing projects within designated wilderness areas, except where authorized by the President); see also Hudson River-Black River Regulation Dist., 33 FERC ¶ 61,122, at 61,261 (1985) (“We deny applications for a preliminary permit where licensing of the project to be studied is clearly statutorily precluded, because no purpose would be served by issuing a permit for a proposed development that could not be licensed.”); Woods Creek, Inc., 19 FERC  ¶ 61,181, at 61,348–49 (1982) (denying a permit for a project proposed in a designated wilderness area).

	Based upon the forgoing, the permit application demonstrates that it should be denied as it clearly statutorily precluded. No purpose would be served by issuing a permit for a proposed development that cannot be licensed.


Very truly yours,
Bennett D. Krasner
