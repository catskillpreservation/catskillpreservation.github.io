Re: Project P-15056 Ashokan Pumped Storage 

Dear Secretary Bose,

I am a tax paying home owner with properties in the hamlets of Chichester, Allaben and Phoenicia in the town of Shandaken. I am wholly against the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project being proposed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by Premium Energy Holdings (PEH) , docket number P-15056.

While I support the production of energy that is not based on fossil fuels, this project is not appropriate for the proposed locations for numerous reasons stated by so many others.

•	This project is not compatible with New York State’s desire to protect and preserve forests and wildlife. All proposed reservoirs are within the Audubon NY Catskill Peaks Forest Important Bird Area (IBA).

•	The system’s impact on turbidity levels of the Ashokan Reservoir which supplies both local and 40% of New York City’s water, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. The proposal threatens this valuable asset, which holds the distinction of being the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation.

•	The potential benefits of the project are minimal to the “public good” compared to the value of these lands for conservation of biodiversity as well as the ecological services provided to the People of the Unites States by such lands.

•	The project is not closed loop as proposed due to the fact that the Esopus Creek runs into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir. 

•	Siting a project such as this within the Catskill Forest Preserve would be unforgivable from a biodiversity conservation prospective. The Catskill Forrest Preserve is considered Status 2 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program.  According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development."

•	The Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) as it relates to the NYC watershed and water supply would need to be renegotiated with the USEPA before preliminary work on this project could proceed.

I respectfully request that FERC deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Lee Wecker
