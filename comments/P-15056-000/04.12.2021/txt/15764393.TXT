Project Docket.  P-15056



Problems with Premium Energy’s proposed pumped storage hydro facility:

Premium Energy has still not formally informed Greene County officials (Lanesville site), as per the application directive.

Premium Energy is applying for a closed loop system project of which the Ashokan Reservoir is not.  It has ingress and egress of the Esopus Creek and others.

The land In question in the application is protected in the NYS Constitution as the Catskill Forest Preserve and the Catskill State Park under Article XIV.  It is forever wild and not to be sold or taken by any corporation.  

The land is also Status 1 under the USGS.  The Department of Energy states that Status 1 lands are to be avoided in the DOE’s hydro vision projects.

Other detrimental impacts include loss of habitat for endangered species, wildlife, and fish.  Damage to the environment would impact fish spanning, ecosystems, infrastructure and tourism.

Although pumped hydro storage is important, this is not an excepted environment for this project based on legitimacy, correct information in the application, and lack of transparency on the part of Premium Energy.

I believe they have not yet completed one of these projects.  This fragile system is not the place to start.
