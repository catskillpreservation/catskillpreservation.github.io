Dear Madame or Sir:

I am writing to urge that all public officials oppose this Permit from Premium Energy Holdings. The proposal is a clear and present danger to the immediate environment, to the Ashokan Reservoir, and ultimately to the precious drinking water of New York City. 

Thank you, 
James Friedlich
