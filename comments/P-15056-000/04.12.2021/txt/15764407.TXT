Open spaces and the small towns or hamlets interconnecting the public open spaces need to be preserved and not sacrificed for energy production.

The Catskill preserve provides a haven and respite into nature for some of the most populous areas of the nation. The Catskills are drivable for a day trip from many of the commuting communities of New York City.

In a time of pandemic and an awareness of the need for open, shared, public, wilderness spaces, the Catskills should continue to be preserved.

Climate change is real. Preserve the existing open spaces. Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California should develop in its own backyard in Southern California as oppose to here in on the east coast. 

Lastly, pursuant to Rule 214 of the Rules, Practices and Procedures (18 CFR Section 385.314), the Catskill Mountainkeeper, a non-profit organization with its primary office in Livingston Manor in Sullivan County New York and a satellite office in Woodstock in Ulster County New York, should be granted full party status in the Docket # P-15056 â€“ Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proceeding by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
