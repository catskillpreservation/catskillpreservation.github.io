I’m writing to oppose the plan for a hydroelectric plant proposed by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, your docket number P-15056.

I lived within just a few miles of the Ashokan for a number of years though now am only a visitor. (I still vested as a landowner in Ulster County.) The  pain afflicted on the people whose families lived there for generations by the creation of the reservoir a hundred years ago is still felt. The raw scars to the land are healed, but the scars to their hearts remain and is shared by those of us who come more lately to the land. 

I can only speak from my heart, not with the authority of professionals as to why this project should be denied. I know that those people have given you clear reasons the project should not be allowed here, but let my voice be joined with them in saying no, no no, this project shouldn’t be placed in this location.

Please listen to the voices of local citizens like Kate McGloughlin whose families were dislocated from what is now the Ashokan basin, who still wrestle with reconciliation, listen to the voices of those who have come more recently to the land of the Catskills they call the Ashokan.  We are against renewable energy, who could be against that, but do not undervalue once  again, a rural way of life, our lifestyle and livelihoods. 

Using Kate McGloughlin’s words directly, “I openly and publicly resent the process by which a non-local, for-profit company can apply to a non-local commission to make an application to begin an operation that would be so deleterious to another person’s homeland.
It will be a great day when renewable energy is delivered through a not-for-profit coalition that actually has an understanding of holistic progress, not by a process that undercuts the obvious way of the future (renewable energy) by devastating the delicate ecology of humanity and wilderness that is the hallmark of the Catskill Mountains.”

Sincerely,
Mary Lou Ganio
