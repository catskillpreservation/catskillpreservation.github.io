This proposal is unacceptable. The project would necessitate construction in a very fragile area of the Catskills, which our Constitution necessitates stay forever wild. The turbidity the project would introduce into the Ashokan Reservoir would be damaging to the New York City water supply as well as the downstream ecology. This permit should not be granted
