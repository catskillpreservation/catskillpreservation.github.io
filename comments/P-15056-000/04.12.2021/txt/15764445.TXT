Re: Docket P-15056-000
MOTION TO INTERVENE of Nicholas Arbatsky for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

Dear Secretary Bose,
This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. 

Nicholas Arbatsky is filing a motion to be an intervener and meets the requirements of 18 CFR385.214 of the Commissionâ€™s regulations to be granted full party status.
The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project in Woodland Valley, New York which would mean that I would lose my home and access to 3 other  properties owned by my family.  I'm concerned that three of these properties would be underwater and I would lose access to the fourth. 
Therefore, I have substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 462 Woodland Valley Rd, Phoenicia NY.
I, Nicholas Arbatsky respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Respectfully,
Nicholas Arbatsky
