Basis for Intervening:
Motion to Intervene of Edward Ripley-Duggan for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. P-15056

As a resident of Olivebridge, an impacted community and as a taxpayer in that community, which is part of the town of Olive in Ulster County, the State of New York, the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will significantly impact the immediate environment and further, will be deleterious to constitutionally protected public land that I have a stakeholder interest in as a contributing taxpayer.

The proposed Wittenberg dam is about four miles from my home; the alternative proposed Woodland Valley and Stony Clove locations impact major trailheads in the Catskill Park system, and as a one-time officer of the Catskill 3500 Club and a keen outdoorsman this is of deep concern to me. Additionally, there will be major impacts at all of the proposed sites on endangered and threatened species, and it appears that Premium Energy, the applicant for this permit, has insufficiently researched these environmental impacts.  The deleterious effect on the Ashokan Reservoir and New York Cityâ€™s drinking water is of major concern, as is the impact on the Forever Wild status of protected Catskill lands, and the detrimental character of this development the Catskill Forest Preserve as a whole. 

I, Edward Ripley-Duggan, respectfully request that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings.
