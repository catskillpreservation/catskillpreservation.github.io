Re: Docket P-15056-000 
MOTION TO INTERVENE of Brookelyn Parslow for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056 

Dear Secretary Bose, 
This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Brookelyn Parslow is filing a motion to be an intervener and meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commissionâ€™s regulations to be granted full party status. 

My basis for intervening is that the construction of the proposed project would mean that I would lose my lifelong home and access to my parent's property. Therefore, I have a substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 241 Moonhaw Rd, West Shokan NY 12494.
Brookelyn Parslow respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene. 

Respectfully, 
Brookelyn Parslow
241 Moonhaw Rd
West Shokan, NY 12494
