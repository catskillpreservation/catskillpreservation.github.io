Basis for Intervening:
I am a resident of the Town of Olive. I live in Catskill Park, which enjoys a protected status. I am concerned about the inevitable effects on our fish, wildlife and plant life. I also have grave concerns about what will happen not only to our drinking water but to the water in the Ashokan Reservoir that comes out of the taps of 9 million New York City residents.

For these and a multitude of other reasons, I am requesting intervenor status.

Thank you,
Tom Parker
