Basis for Intervening:
Motion to intervene in Premium Energy Holdings, LLC proposal for the Ashokan pumped storage hydroelectric project. 
I live in West Shokan (32 McMillan Road) very close to the area that has been proposed for high power electric lines, and am concerned that they would be run across my property or very near it. As well, I avail myself of the extraordinary forest preserve in my immediate area and would be devastated to see it destroyed. I have been horrified by the inaccurate, poorly-planned proposal that gave no thought to the particulars of this region; its tourist economy, its pristine streams, its history of trauma from the huge eminent domain destruction of many towns, etc. etc. This company shows no ability to treat the environment I treasure with any sensitivity or smarts. To have a dam so close to my home that would be privately owned, so that if flooding or other issues came up the local government would have no recourse to respond, is just one of the many many nightmare scenarios this proposal has brought up. 
I request a motion to intervene to be part of the process of seeing and affecting this proposal's status.
