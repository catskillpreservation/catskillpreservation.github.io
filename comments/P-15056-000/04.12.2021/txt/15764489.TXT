RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE Docket # P-15056 â€“ Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Secretary Bose:

Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Rules, Practices and Procedures (18 CFR Section 385.314), Janice and Gary Kachadourian, owners of the property at 1560 Route 214, Lanesville, NY, 12450, hereby petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant full party status in the above captioned proceeding. The persons to whom communications should be addressed and to whom service should be made are as follows:

Janice and Gary Kachadourian
1560 Route 214
Lanesville, NY 12450
845-688-3231
sunnyfield818@gmail.com

As grounds for this Motion, we state that we are full-time residents at the above address, and it is our only residence.  Our residence is in the immediate path of one of the proposed project sites, Stony Clove in Lanesville, and thus we are in danger of losing our home.  We also stand at risk of serious harm from the construction and operation of the project, as well as from additional infrastructure necessary to service it, such as the Ashokan Switchyard, powerhouse, and transmission lines. In light of the foregoing, we respectfully petitions for intervention.

Sincerely,

Janice and Gary Kachadourian
1560 Route 214
Lanesville, NY 12450
845-688-3231
