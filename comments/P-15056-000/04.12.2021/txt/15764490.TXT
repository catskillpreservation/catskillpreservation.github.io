Basis for Intervening:
I am a long time business owner in Shandaken so I feel I have enough acumen to have pragmatic view on the proposed project from the perspective of return on investment. I look at it from both sides: the residents and business owners vs project investing company. All seems to me as loose/loose preposition:
Impact on forest preserve ecology, impact on tourism business, possible impact on property values 
on one side vs costs of amending the state constitution for permitting the project on the state forest preserve lands, enormous legal fees to justify playing with local and NY City water supply and review processes costs necessary to obtain green light for the project.
