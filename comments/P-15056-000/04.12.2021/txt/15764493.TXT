I'm a resident of Marbletown.  My 15 acres borders the Esopus Creek, which spills off the Ashokan Reservoir.  I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE the use of the protected lands near the reservoir for another dam, turbine & tunnels as proposed by Premium Energy Holdings.  I encourage the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny the application.  The proposed project will cause great damage to our beloved, protected and historic area.  The proposed project must not be allowed to be constructed as it will damage local lands, roads, streams, historic properties and cause turbidity in waters serving as the drinking water for the 9 million people of New York City.  Please do everything in your power to PREVENT THIS DISASTROUS PROPOSAL FROM MOVING FORWARD.
Thank you,
Bruce Littlefield & Scott Stewart
