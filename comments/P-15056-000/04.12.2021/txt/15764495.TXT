Basis for Intervening:
Dear Commission,

My family has inhabited the Catskills since the 1700s. The Moonhaw site contains ruins of my family homestead. This is where Premium Energy seeks to put another reservoir.

I am a Professor of Rural STEM Education whose career research entails documenting local rural knowledge connected to people, ecosystems and place.  I am also a first generation college graduate of Cornell University whose land-grant mission is rooted in agriculture, history and place. My family history and career work is deeply connected to, and rooted in,  place. I want Premium Energy and FERC to learn about the Complex Connectivity of Place so that the full impacts of P-15056 are understood beyond those shared previously by the DEP (comments submitted 4/8/21). 

Connection between people and place is extremely complex and well-documented in Indigenous and non-Indigenous literatures (Basso, 1996; Fikret & Berkes, 2008; Kassam, 2009:2020; Joppa, et al, 2016; Smith, 2013; Ruelle et al, 2019) and neuroscience and environmental psychology alike (Hebgeb & Kistemann, 2012; Rollero & DePiccoli, 2010; Williams & Seward, 1998). “Socio-cultural and ecological systems are linked through relationships between people and their environment, which includes both relations between humans and relations between humans and other animals, plants and their habitats [Wohlleben, 2016]...thus illuminating the complex connectivity of human ecological relations" (Kassam, 2010, p. 2). These connections begin at an early age as evidenced by photodocumentation interviews with 100 NYS rural children (Avery & Kassam, 2011), and include social, emotional and behavioral components. Research also shows that the cognitive relevance of Indigenous and rural knowledge is critical to survival (Kassam, Avery & Ruelle, 2017). Knowledge, memory, stories, identity, and community is intertwined with, and attached to, place (Avery & Hains, 2017).  Significant interactions between people and the natural environment have been recognized as cultural landscapes (UNESCO, 2021). Simply put, place is more than a zip code.

This region was taken by eminent domain in the early 1900s to build the Ashokan Reservoir. The towns of Olive and Hurley including villages/hamlets of West Hurley, Glenford, Ashton, Olive Branch, Brown's Station, Olivebridge, Olive City, Brodhead's Bridge, Shokan, West Shokan and Boiceville, were taken or relocated. These rural communities' sense of place, identity, and their alternative ways of knowing and being that are in relationship with the ecosystems - were disrupted or forever lost in the flooding. As evidenced in the many documents of the takings hearings (which I have read for my research), these families were dismissed, disrespected and diminished, and the majority, were never compensated for their losses. We were then colonized for water, and now energy (Beisaw, 2016; Thomas, 2015), and the intergenerational trauma persists. 

P-15056 involves a for-profit corporation from California using a map program to situate a project that will again disrupt communities, ecosystems and place. This project aims to again colonize (following the very same 5-step colonization playbook used for generations across national and international contexts - see below) the same rural communities and repeats the intergenerational trauma caused by the first takings (Avery, 2019). Disruption from place is an evisceration, not a change of address. 

[Ironically, Premium Energy seeks to do the very same to the City of NY by colonizing and disrupting what is now their ecosystem and Water Supply System, and in so doing, puts the lives of 9 million people at risk by contaminating NYC’s drinking water.]


Here we are now in phase #5 “Decolonization” that entails the individual’s rejection of the colonizer and their victimization, and the rebirth of resistance and resurgence, particularly by descendants (5th- 6th generation => me) who want their families’ and communities’ stories told. As Tom Petty’s song goes…“Don’t back down.” Thus, I apply to be an intervenor this time around because I want Premium Energy to look me in the eye as they plan to eviscerate my family and place once again. 


Phases of colonization (adapted from Fanon, 1963) 
1.	Colonizer's forced entry into territory to exploit natural resources and inhabitants
2.	Colonizer imposes its culture, disintegrates the Indigenous or non-Indigenous culture
3.	Colonizer is portrayed as more civilized, the colonized as wild, savage, and uncivilized and its the colonizer's responsibility to monitor, tame and civilize
4.	Establishment of a society where the political, social and economic institutions are designed to benefit and maintain the superiority of the colonizer while continuing to subjugate the colonized
5.	Decolonization: rejection of the colonizer and their victimization, and the rebirth of resistance and resurgence, particular by descendants (5th- 6th generation) who want their families’ and communities’ stories told
