Basis for Intervening:
This is to request Intervener status on the hydro-electric power station and
dam project proposed by Premium Energy, FERC Docket id P-15056-000.
My property at 99 Dry Brook Road in West Shokan will be directly impacted by the Wittenberg Reservoir since part of that project will be on my land, and more generally my property will be impacted by the installation of power lines, tunnels and dams in the area.
