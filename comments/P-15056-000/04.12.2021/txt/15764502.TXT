Basis for Intervening:
Please allow this to serve as my request for Intervenor status. I am a land owner in the Catskill Park. These are highly protected lands. My concerns should this project go forward, in addition to the legalities of it being on state park land, revolve around the adverse effects on my well water, on our rare and endangered species, and on our trout waters. 

I have no confidence in Premier Energy's ability to construct a dam when they are unable to even see to the detail of getting the name of our town right in their proposal for a preliminary permit. I fear for our safety.

Thank you,
Linda L. Werner
