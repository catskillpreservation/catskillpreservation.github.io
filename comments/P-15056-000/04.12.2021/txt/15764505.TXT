I object to the development of a hydroelectric facility in the Ashokan reservoir area in the Catskills. 
There is no need for antiquated technology to provide energy. There are enough green options that do not necessitate  the destruction of the natural environment and force the displacement of residents. 
It is paramount that we preserve the natural resources and environment in this region. 
There are enough social and environmental emergencies driving an influx of displaced people in the area. We need to think of low impact environmental solutions that are sustainable over the long term. 
I do not support the project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings and request that local and regional authorities tasked with the preservation and protection of our parks and reserves refute the science behind this attempt at commercialization of our beautiful and pristine region and stop this development.
