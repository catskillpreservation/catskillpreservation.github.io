The construction process & harmful alterations thereafter made to the local environment by this proposed Project will forever have a negative impact on these natural mountains that the Ernst family has loved throughout generations past, current, and certainly of the future.Â  This proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project must not proceed.
