It was with horror that I read of the proposed hydroelectric project! This project as would impair our quality of life here beyond repair.

This project would require years of pollution-producing construction, destroying our natural environment. The habitat for our cherished wildlife: our bears, coyotes, deer, and bald eagles, the entire web, would be destroyed. Huge power lines would denigrate irreparably our beautiful mountain and reservoir views. Our ability to hike the wilderness freely would be blocked. This is Catskill Park!

In short, all the reasons that we live here would be destroyed and altered beyond recognition. We have other, safer, less destructive, more decentralized ways to generate more electricity, such as rooftop solar panels.

I am committed to fighting this proposal tooth and nail, and encourage my neighbors to fight it also. We will be united against this.

Thank you.
