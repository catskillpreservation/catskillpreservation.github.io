Kimberly D. Bose
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First St. NE, Room 1A
Washington, D.C. 20426.
Docket number P-15056-000
 
Dear Ms. Bose,
 
As a resident and long-term property owner in Woodland Valley in the Town of Shandaken, I strongly object to Premium Energy Holding’s proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny their application for a preliminary permit. 
 
My family’s home valley is under proposed consideration as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and the generation of electricity.  
 
The proposed project is an unprecedented large-scale disruption to the Catskill Forest Preserve, will undermine the tax base to the area and will effect the public drinking water system to the New York City metropolitan area. How can a project of this  magnitude safely address the mandates set forth by New York’s Department of Conservation to protect the water quality in our area? 
 
Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources cannot come at the cost of environmental and community devastation.  I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project where the construction and operation do not destroy protected wilderness, displace thriving communities, and threaten the Catskill’s unique natural resources.  Please do everything in your power to prevent the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposal, docket number P-15056-000 from moving forward. 

Sincerely,
Ann Tortorelli
