The role of renewable energy must be to supply the needs of a modern civilization while supporting the natural systems of the earth that sustains us. This requires equally also, a stewardship of land that holds some of the last pristine natural resources that are critical to organized life on our planet. Water, Forest, and Habitat CANNOT be lost at the expense of building renewable energy infrastructure, it would be completely counter to the initiative as a whole. I live on a stream in the Catskills, it serves an integral purpose from the moment it rushes out of the ground on the side of Panther Mountain, it is sometimes a raging torrent, sometimes a trickle. It cannot be held by man-made earthworks without a devastating outcome. Mergansers and Herons nest and rear their young, trout spawn and travel down to the Esopus. Over the years we have participated in NYS programs for restoring and protecting our riparian area with plantings of native trees, and we tend carefully and consciously to our space along it. We also maintain a vacation rental cabin on our property, so we understand the ecosystem of people as well as the mountain around here – all of the Catskills serves as a nature retreat for the city of New York in a long standing relationship – providing clean water and a much needed connection to nature, while supporting the communities and businesses that live here year round. Hydroelectric power, although a critical component to a future that moves us from the terminal outlook of fossil fuel dependency, DOES NOT belong in this important Protected  Nature Preserve. 
Thank you for your time.
