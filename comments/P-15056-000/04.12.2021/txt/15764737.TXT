The proposed hydropower project in the Catskills can not move forward. It is hard to list the number of ways in which the costs do not justify the potential rewards. Catskill ravines, mountains, waterways and ecosystems are not renewable, in fact they are extremely finite. 

Clean energy storage is important but especially in the Catskills all efforts must be taken to preserve the far more valuable resource of the natural landscape and ecosystem itself. This stands over and above the obvious benefit that the Catskill region receives from stewarding and lightly exploiting this magnificent landscape. All this beside the risks to the NYC water supply, which is easily one of the most precious water supply systems in the world, and which we are so lucky to have. 

Sincerely,
Matt Raue
