Hello,

I’m writing as a visitor to this amazing area, and a student who recently completed a water governance course taught at Columbia University. The studies remain inconclusive about the positive contributions of hydroelectic dams (across the globe), let alone when you factor in the harm done to neighboring communities displaced as a result of their build.

What remains true (and our Professor studied at NASA) is that power and democracy must be fairly introduced when it comes to ensuring due process plays out in accordance with current governance requirements. The relationship between society and water is complex, and its critical to our enjoyment and livelihoods.

Integrated water resource management requires deep understanding, and as an avid hiker and visitor to this particular area, I’m appalled that you believe your corporation is better equipped to steward the lands than 1) the original stewardship laws put in place 2) the stakeholders who reside in and around this area.

Please reconsider your decision and the irreparable harm it stands to have. In your rush for business objectives, think beyond the short term and understand that nature knows best. Not your private (less than transparent about process ) pockets.

Do what is right for future generations. Leave Ashokan alone.
