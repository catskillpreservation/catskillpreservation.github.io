We are responding to the information regarding the Ashokan Pump Storage Project-  We are strongly opposed to initiating a system that would put high tension lines from Olive to Hurley-  this area is known for its peacefulness and beauty and to rip a corridor thru the woods for a non needed purpose makes no sense.   We have lived here for MANY years and have never felt that we were short electricity  - we have never even had an outage that had lasted for any concern able amount of time.  If people cant go without power for short periods of time - maybe they should move to a more populated area .   This proposal also can affect what limited resources we have in this area-  people come to drive, hike and bike throughout the region-  imagine driving up 28 and turn to look at the mountains and see a trail of metal monsters instead - if you want continue to destroy California-  you are more than welcome to go back there.
