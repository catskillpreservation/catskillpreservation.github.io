FERC should deny this permit for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP.  

This project would flood NYS constitutionally protected forest preserve land.  This land has very high conservation value due to the large intact forest tracts in the area, and would require a change to the New York State constitution to allow this project.  

This project is not a closed loop system as Premium Energy claims incorrectly in their application.  This is not the type of project that DOE is looking for.
This project would also require a renegotiation of the EPA's Filtration avoidance determination that the New York City drinking water supply is currently operating under.
