As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holdingâ€™s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.
This is a text I can wholeheartedly sign. Speaking for myself: ?!?! A company from CA, that is facing similar strenuous opposition for their ill-thought projects in other states (NV, CA) wants to build similar ill-thought project in protected/preserved land in NY?! Asking for a permit behind the backs of people whose property, their homes and land, would be seized by eminent domain and flooded?! Threatening supply of drinking water for almost 10 million people in NYC?! Ruining the ecology of the Ashokan watershed?! And what for? So, some already rich investors can get richer out of that!!!
