I am writing to express concern over the application by Premium Energy to construct a hydroelectric dam on the Ashokan reservoir. This is an extremely sensitive area from an ecological standpoint - home to trout and bald eagles. The Ashokan reservoir is also one of the primary sources of drinking water for New York City. Construction of this project would lead to changes in habitat and an increase turbidity that would have an extremely negative impact on the animals and humans who rely on these pristine waters.

Additionally, the proposed location on the Stony Clove Creek would disrupt commerce and tourism which is critical to the area's economic health. Route 214 connects the towns of Phoenicia and Hunter/Tannersville. It provides access to ski resorts, hiking trails, grocery and hardware stores, gas stations, etc. It is one of the few roads in this area and is well traveled. It is also a scenic byway and goes through some of the most sensitive and protected land in the state. Rerouting, closure, changes to the scenery would all have negative impacts on the beauty, ecology and the economy of the area.

I ask that you please reject the application for this permit. Thank you, Chloe Metz
