 I am writing in response to the permit that Premium energy has requested for a study on a proposed pumped storage hydro plant.

Building the kind of plant that Premium has proposed continues the methodology of the past- build a huge monolith that displaces people and wildlife- some endangered- from their homes.

We have learned form the past that intruding on wildlife areas has caused endangerment of the species that inhabit those areas; the American Eagle, already endangered, inhabits the areas that Premium is targeting
  
The building of the Ashokan Reservoir at the turn of the century in order to provide water to New York City inhabitants, displaced residents from generational homes. Why we we consider a project that would do this again?


I am in full support of the development of clean alternative renewable energy sources.

Why not encourage the development of energy on a smaller, non invasive platform? New technologies and methods would have to be developed- but isn't that we Americans do best? Innovate?

Please fell free to contact me directly with any questions or comments.

Thank you,
Maureen d. Hirschfield
