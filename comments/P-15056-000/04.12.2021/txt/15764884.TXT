I'm a 28 year resident and taxpayer in Olive and object wholeheartedly to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  It will drastically diminish water quality, raise temperature in our water to kill fish, add horrible and health-diminishing high voltage transmission lines and a flurry of other things which will RUIN the beauty and water safety in the Hudson Valley where I live, play and enjoy my life...and where I pay taxes.  I object strongly to the entire project.
