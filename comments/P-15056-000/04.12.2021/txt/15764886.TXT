To Whom It May Concern:

Sharing my concerns and Objections to the proposed project of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project in the Catskill Mountains.

Sustainable energy is important more than ever but so is preservation of NYC and regions drinking water.
The preservation of many endangered species, recreational use of waterways and livelihoods of residents in the Catskills
are also at stake with this extraordinarily disruptive project.

In the strongest way I object to this project and the harm that it would cause so many in the region and beyond. 

Sincerely,
Jenny Lynn McNutt
