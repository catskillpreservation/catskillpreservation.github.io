I am writing to oppose the Premium Energy project in the Catskills.  

My family lives in Woodland Valley right in the center of one of the proposed damns which makes my objection to this project slightly more personal.  We love the beauty and the peace of this area.  My daughter would just soon look for eagles than look at her ipad.  The water in the Catskills is one of its greatest resources and not to be tampered with.  Most of us rely on well water as our drinking water and spend countless hours on the many waterways here enjoying nature in all its splendor.  Catskills Park has always been a refuge for those seeking a break from their busy city lives - never more so than this last year during the pandemic.  It would be so sad to see this protected area be exploited for profit and set a scary precedence for  other protected areas like it.  Thank you.
