RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE: Docket # P-15056 - Ashokan Pumped Storage Project Dear 

Secretary Bose: 

I would like to comment on Docket # P-15056 . The person to whom communication should be addressed is Katie Bull, 891 Ashokan Rd, Kingston, NY 12401, katiebullvox@gmail.com, 917-754-2990.

 I live on a mountain in Lomontville within 15 miles of the Ashokan Reservoir and within 15 miles of the proposed alternative sites for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Projectâ€™s Upper Reservoir and other towns and cities served by the Ashokan Reservoir as a source of drinking water. And while I recognize that hydro storage can be environmentally useful, the question is *where is as pumped storage project least ecologically damaging?* The proximity of this proposed project to small towns, recreation and wildlife, is harmful.

Please allow citizen comments and the dialogue with organizations filing motions to intervene, to continue. 

Many Thanks,
Katie Bull
