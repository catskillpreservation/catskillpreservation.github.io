To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing to express my opposition, in the strongest possible terms, to Premium Energy Holding’s request for a preliminary permit for their Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 proposal. I urge FERC to consider the proposal’s harmful environmental impact, disruption of existing communities, and degradation of highly preserved land in a manner that poses economic threat to the Catskills alongside the obvious environmental challenges of such an “add-on” project.

Premium Energy Holding’s proposed use of land within the Catskills Forest Preserve stands in direct contradiction to the terms under which the land is protected in the New York State Constitution. The proposal simply does not meet the requirement that the lands “be forever kept as wild forest lands,” nor does the limited benefit of this add-on project merit the disruption of one of the state’s most important habits for wildlife. The project’s anticipated negative impact on local stream ecology – not to mention the possibility of risks posed to the vital water supply of the Ashokan Reservoir – give further reason for pause.
  
I grew up in the neighboring community of Rhinebeck, NY, and have both fond personal memories of times spent in the area in question, and many family and friends who would be directly impacted by this project, were it to be approved. Premium Energy Holding’s bad-faith representations in their proposal – including the preposterous idea that their proposed construction of an upper reservoir be somehow considered a “closed-loop” project, when it is clearly an “add-on” project – only underscore the threat of turning over these vitally important lands to an unscrupulous outside developer who has already shown willingness to blatantly misrepresent their project in order to ease its acceptance.

I thank you for your time, and for your consideration of this comment, and hope you will heed the numerous community members who stand opposed to this misuse of our beloved forests.
