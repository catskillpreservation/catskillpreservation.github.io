Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing this letter in opposition to granting a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings LLC for their proposed project hydroelectric project for the Shokan reservoir in the Catskills forest preserve. There are many reasons for this preliminary permit to be granted but for me the most glaring is the disruption of the watershed of the Ashokan and how their plans would be a detriment to the ecology of the area. It is also a poorly conceived plan for the three proposed dammed reservoir and pumping station which are described as closed loop storage but are actually add on storage facilities. All three proposed sites would impede on water flow to the watershed of the Ashokan reservoir which would greatly affect the water resource of New York City. I hope that you will deny this preliminary permit for this project. 
Thank you 
Matthew A Yanchuk
