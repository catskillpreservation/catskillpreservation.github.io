Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

This letter is in regards to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Because of detriment to the environment, community and New York City’s drinking water, I hope FERC will decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I understand and support the benefits of renewable energy; however, the lasting and devastating effects to the surrounding land and wildlife of the Catskills needs to be a priority. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The pumped storage is known to damage wildlife, stream ecology and the surrounding lands.  Local communities are also at risk with Premium Energy’s proposal. The upper reservoirs proposed would lead to people losing their homes. Due to the current housing shortage, community members displaced by the project would have a difficult time finding new homes.

Renewable energy shouldn’t be at the cost of local communities and the their economy environment. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a better-suited location. The current plan will destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Shannon Perrotta
