I’d like to voice my opposition to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project using Hydro Power. The location in which the proposed project is being considered is a beautiful, largely unspoiled area in The Catskill Mountains, within lands supposedly protected by New York’s designation of them as Catskill State Park. We who live here value the natural beauty, the lack of overdevelopment, the clean air, and the flora and fauna. Much of our area’s economy is based on the same things - they are much of the reason tourists from NYC and beyond come here. A project such as this could only harm all of that. Something else to keep in mind is that another project here over a hundred years ago drastically changed the landscape for the worse and negatively affected several towns and displaced thousands of residents - The Ashokan Reservoir. Although in the century since then, people have come to accept and embrace it, pushing another similar (although on a smaller scale) project through here would be a huge mistake, and would be extremely inconsiderate to the residents and others who love this place. Furthermore, the area is a part of the watershed for New York City’s drinking water, and any industrial construction or related traffic could possibly negatively affect the city’s water quality.
