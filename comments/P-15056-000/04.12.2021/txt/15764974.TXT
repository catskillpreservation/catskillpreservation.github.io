Save Catskill Preserve

Our region of the Catskills is most poignant because THE WORLD learned about us through a fine artist named Thomas Cole. The Hudson River School of Artists followed in his footsteps continuing to illustrate the picturesque clean inspirational landscape.

We must honor and uphold their vision FOREVER as a guide for humans to navigate in the political cultural scene.  I join the comments made by the other organizations and individuals in reference to environmental issues, commercial enterprises and life for the locals, etc.

Our Catskill Park provides a haven and resource of such high value. The scientists and engineers must come up with an alternative energy plan.

I am in opposition to the proposed hydroelectric power generator in the Stony Clove, NY, Catskill Mountains.
