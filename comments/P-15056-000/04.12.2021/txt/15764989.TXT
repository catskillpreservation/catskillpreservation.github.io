Re:  Docket #P-15056 – 000 / Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

I am writing to voice my opposition to the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (docket #P-15056-000.
This project would likely affect the 9.5 million residents of NY City as well as many Hudson Valley communities that rely on its drinking water.  Also, the project has significant implications on the health of the Esopus Creek and the communities on its banks. It will compromise the Catskills, running roughshod over our forests and wildlife.
Per my comments above this project seems ill conceived and must be stopped – now.
I appreciate your consideration and understanding regards my concern and opposition to this project.

Sincerely,
Jerry
