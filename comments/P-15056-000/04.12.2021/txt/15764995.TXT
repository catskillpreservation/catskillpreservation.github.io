This is an ill-conceived proposal that is prohibited under the New York State Constitution and federal law.  Its implementation would be quite obviously destructive to thousands of acres of natural habitat, rob families from their homes, and very likely be detrimental to the public infrastructure and drinking water quality for the City of New York.  The benefits of this proposed hydroelectric project are infinitesimal when compared to the clear risks of irreversible damage to pristine lands that are called home by people and wildlife alike.  It should be given no further consideration as it is not at all feasible or beneficial to any party other than the applicant itself.
