As a frequent visitor to the Woodland Valley NY area for the past 48 years I would like to let you know that I oppose the application by Premium Energy Holdings to build a pumped-storage hydropower facility in this area.
 
This proposed project would destroy state land and have disastrous effects on the ecology of the Esopus.  The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County, and according to the NYS Constitution the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Premium’s permit is requesting access to these lands.
 
I vehemently object to Premium Energy Holding’s proposal and ask that you, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reject their preliminary permit.
 
Thank you.
