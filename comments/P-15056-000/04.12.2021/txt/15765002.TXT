Dear Secretary Bose:

I am writing regarding the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC to build a hydro-powered pumped energy storage facility using the Ashokan Reservoir as the lower reservoir, with one of three potential sites in the surrounding area to be used as the upper reservoir.

While Premium Energy's written proposal holds a number of flaws and incorrect information that warrant a rejection of their request for a preliminary permit, the most egregious is the claim that this project is intended to be a CLOSED-LOOP system (preferred by the DOE, according to DOE's own website) when in fact it is an ADD-ON system, which is far more environmentally destructive. Using the Ashokan Reservoir for this project could work only as an ADD-ON system, not CLOSED-LOOP.

The Ashokan reservoir receives water from local creeks and streams, which then gets distributed as drinking water, supplying 40% of the needs of New York City's 9.5 million residents. The city diligently manages and maintains the Ashokan Reservoir to prevent the kicking up of sediment due to turbulence. If this hydro-pumped energy storage facility is allowed to happen, it would be devastating to the local ecology and the quality of New York City's unfiltered drinking water. 

While I am not against using this kind of system (specifically closed-loop) for energy storage, the Ashokan Reservoir is not the place for it. I am urging the Commission to deny Premium Energy a preliminary permit for this project.

Respectfully,

Ailsa Wong
