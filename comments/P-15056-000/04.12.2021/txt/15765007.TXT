Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing to oppose the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains.  I’ve been a resident of Woodland Valley for 26 years so know first-hand how devastating it would be to destroy our pristine environment with abundant wildlife, a clean beautiful stream, which is an important habitat for trout, and a thriving community.  
The Catskills Forest Preserve is a unique resource because it’s been declared “forever wild” by the NYS Constitution, which states that the land “shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  This ensures clean, untreated drinking water for NYC and 700,000 acres of preserved land that is a treasure for the state of NY.  It would be a crime to destroy this land.
Premium Energy’s proposal demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the communities and natural resources that would be sacrificed by their project.  While I applaud moving towards more sustainable energy sources, it must be led by companies who are willing to work with and understand the needs of communities.  Premium Energy submitted this proposal without any consultation with local stakeholders and communities, which should disqualify them from any similar pursuit in the NYS or elsewhere.
I respectfully ask that FERC deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
Sincerely,
Margaret Neu
