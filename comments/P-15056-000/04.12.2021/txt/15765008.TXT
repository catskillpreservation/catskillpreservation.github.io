I am writing in reference to docket number P-15056-000. I urge you to deny Premium Energy's proposal seeking a feasibility study on building a dam in the Catskills, which are a State Preserve and are protected by the New York State Constitution.
As a native of the Catskill Mountains and a current resident of New York City, this proposed project concerns me greatly. The effects that it could have on the drinking water of both the Catskill region and New York City could be devastating, and negatively affect millions of people. 
Furthermore, the impact it could have on the natural ecosystem could be disastrous. The Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s ownHydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
The residents of the Catskills and anyone who could be affected by this should, and legally speaking must, have a say in whether a project like this goes forward.
Thank you.
