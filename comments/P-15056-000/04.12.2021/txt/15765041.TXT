I am opposed to the Premium Energys proposed Ashokan pumped storage project.
As a West Shokan home owner local business owner and working musician I would like the Catskill Preserve to remain an attractive destination for people who visit from around the world.
As stated Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

Clearly Premium Energy is not aware that the drinking water of nine million people is at stake!

I urge FERC to not grant this permit. p-15056

Thank you Amit
