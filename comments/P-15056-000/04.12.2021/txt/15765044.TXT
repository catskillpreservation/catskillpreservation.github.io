Re:  The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

The Premium Energy Holdings proposal to initiate a hydroelectric project involving the environs of the Ashokan Reservoir is vacant of any consideration of the economic and cultural circumstances of the Western Catskills, let alone the role of the Catskills in supplying abundant, high quality, safe drinking water for residents of New York City. 

My husband and I were born and raised in the region and returned as permanent residents following our retirement. We cherish the natural beauty of the Catskills and are active in hiking, skiing, kayaking, biking, fishing, and hunting pursuits.  Further, the region benefits significantly from the increasing numbers of tourists and second homeowners coming to the Catskills to live and recreate.     

The region faces uncertainty now given increased traffic, the threats of climate change, and a severe housing shortage at times blocking young families from settling here.  Communities are joining together to learn about and plan to mitigate these challenges going forward.  The Premium Energy Holdings proposal appears to stand everything currently underway on its' head! It is not only ill-conceived but demonstrates little recognition of the complex regulatory entities that must be consulted in taking on such initiatives in the Catskills.

While organizations more deeply steeped in technical details of the issues involved are weighing in, I believe it is important that individual citizens speak up when threats necessitate. We respectfully ask that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stop this this project in its tracks now.

Thank you for your consideration,
Bill and Diane Munro
