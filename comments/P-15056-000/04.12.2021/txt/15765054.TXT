I am absolutely against the Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California's proposed pumped-storage hydroelectric facility within the Catskill Forest Preserve. This proposal is within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve and directly threatens the ecological sustainability of the Preserve.  Among many other negative impacts, it would threaten trout breeding grounds, the quality of the NYC water supply, the experience of trail users in the preserve.  This impacts the local landscape, wildlife, plants, and people.  I stand with dozens of nonprofit and environmental groups opposing this project.

Thank you,
