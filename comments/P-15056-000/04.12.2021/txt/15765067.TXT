I write in objection to the proposed hydro-electric dam to be built in the Catskill Preserve. As a long-time resident of this area, I think this project would be fatally damaging to our tourism industry, which depends on the natural beauty of our environment. Wildlife would be negatively impacted, with loss of habitat. The disruption of this major construction would be devastating to residents and tourists alike. Not to mention the private homes which would be destroyed in the process â€“ where are these people supposed to go? Please vote to DENY this proposal, which is of no benefit to the people who actually live here and will destroy our way of life.
