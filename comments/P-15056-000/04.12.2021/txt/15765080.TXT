To whom it may concern,
I am writing to oppose Premium Energy Holding’s Hydro-Electric Project in The Catskill Preserve. 
I know Olivebridge and the Ashokan Reservoir well, as my mother’s family has been in the area since the 1700s. My grandmother’s home and general store were the first condemned for the building of the Ashokan Reservoir. The residents of the area still recall the pain and sacrifices made by many families being displaced in that fertile valley in the early 1900s.   

Although supportive of renewable energy as the future, the location of this project would subject, yet again, the residents of this valley to yet another painful upheaval caused by eminent domain. The project will increase the turbidity of the unfiltered Ashokan water that millions of residents rely on in New York City.  It will upend the Catskill Preserve’s “forever wild” clause which is designated by our new York state constitution.  

I urge FERC to consider the injustice of this particular location, and that Premium Energy Holding finds another location for their project.
Thank you,
Camilla Calhoun
