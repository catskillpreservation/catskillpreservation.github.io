Please abandon this proposal. The proposed locations for a new reservoir are in the heart of the Catskills Park, very near or even adjacent to designated wilderness. There are people who live in these valleys, and wildlife that pass through them. There are also water quality concerns for many people who rely on the Ashokan for drinking water.  

I understand the value of pumped storage and its connection to meeting goals for sustainable energy.  But this location is inappropriate. I would much rather see the people of our area take a hard look at reducing their energy demand, than to have the natural and wild areas in our back-country compromised by a another large dam and reservoir.

Sincerely,
Eric Keeling
