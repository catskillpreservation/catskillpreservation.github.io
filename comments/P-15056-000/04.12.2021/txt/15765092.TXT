Premium Energy’s proposed Ashokan Hydroelectric Pumped Storage project is wholly inappropriate for the Catskills. This project was dreamed up by a small, for-profit energy holding company in California. It was not requested by New York State or New York City – the purported beneficiaries of the project. In fact, both OPPOSE this project.

This project would wreak havoc on the environment (protected public lands in the Catskill Forest Preserve). It would harm wildlife and endangered species in the area, inundate hundreds of homes and lands of great cultural and historical significance, and damage a fragile regional economy that depends on tourism and recreation. The project will require the construction of high-tension power lines that would be a huge visual scar (extending for miles) on the scenic beauty of the area. Additionally, it would jeopardize a major drinking water supply for New York City, necessitating that the City construct a filtration system for its water costing billions of dollars. Finally, because it relies on eminent domain for the taking of hundreds of parcels of private property, the project would transfer the land acquisition costs from Premium Energy to the taxpayers of New York. Considering that neither New York State nor New York City desires this project, this last fact adds insult to injury.

The project purports to produce 800 MW of power, but my understanding is that it will require about 400 MW of power to pump water up to the proposed upper reservoir – meaning that the project will only net about 400 MW of power.

Given all the adverse impacts of this proposed project, coupled with the relatively meager increase in power generation, I urge you to deny the application of Premium Energy Holdings at this early juncture.
