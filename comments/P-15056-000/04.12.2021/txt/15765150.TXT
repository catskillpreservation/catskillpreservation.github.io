To Secretary Bose -- 

I would like to comment on the MOTION TO INTERVENE Docket # P-15056 

Both my partner and I come to the Ashokan Reservoir to visit that area for recreational purposes. We have close friends that we call family living within 15 miles of the Ashokan Reservoir and so within 15 miles of the proposed alternative sites for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project's Upper Reservoir and other towns and cities served by the Ashokan Reservoir as a source of drinking water. 

We are concerned. While we recognize that hydro storage can be environmentally useful, the question is where is as pumped storage project least ecologically damaging?. 
The proximity of this proposed project to small towns, their neighbors, the recreation and wildlife is harmful. 

We ask, please to allow citizen comments and the dialogue with organizations filing motions to intervene, to continue. 

Thank you! 
Ilse Pfeifer
