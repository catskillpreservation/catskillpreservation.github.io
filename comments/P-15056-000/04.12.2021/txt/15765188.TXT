The plan of Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Mountains is an incredibly poor idea. Their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project should be denied.
This project would be devastating to the environment, disruptive to local communities, and create a serious risk for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

This plan would damage the protected forests, streams, and wildlife of the Catskill Forest Preserve. The NYS Constitution, Article XIV , guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

Even after construction there will continue to be environmental devastation as pumped storage has a history of damage to the environment on stream ecology, and aquatic and land habitats.
Plus, the New York State Forest Condition ranks the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide. 

The plan is a short sighted attempt to solve one problem and create what could be hundreds of others as it impacts the community, the environment, wildlife, and tourism.
