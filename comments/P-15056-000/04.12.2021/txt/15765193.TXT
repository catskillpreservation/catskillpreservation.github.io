I am writing in opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power energy plant in New York's Catskill Mountains.  I strongly urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 as it would be devastating to the environment, extremely disruptive to local communities and would risk the purity of New York City's drinking water.

I agree with and fully support our country's transition to green energy renewable sources.  However, the transition must not come at the cost of environmental and community destruction and devastation.

Please deny Premium Energy's proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Thank you for you consideration in this matter.
