I am strongly opposed to the “Ashokan” Hydro Project particularly in the Stony Clove Valley.

Hydro Power can have benefits, if it is in the right place. This is not the right place.

It is in the center of the NYC watershed. The NYC water system is one of America’s greatest engineering accomplishments. Clean water is a precious resource. Billions have been spent and continue to be spent to preserve and deliver clean water to NYC. This is a protected area. There’s only one efficient place to get water for NYC… right here in the watershed. There are many sources for alternative energy. The project is not compatible with the need for clean water for NYC. 

It is in the heart of a NY state protected forest and the center for outdoor activity and tourism. Historically It is the first tourist area in the USA.

The area has a growing vibrant economy and community. 

There are better and more cost efficient ways to an alternate fuel future.  


Sincerely, 
Marvin Seligman
