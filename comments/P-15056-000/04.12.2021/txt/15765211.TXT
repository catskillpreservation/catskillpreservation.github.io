Re: PROJECT P-15056 ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT
Dear Ms. Bose,
On behalf of the Town of Lexington, we respectfully request the FERC deny the preliminary permit Premium Energy filed (# P-15056) given the number of serious, unanswered issues with its proposed project, namely the impact on state constitutionally protected land, the impact and disruption to the NYC water supply, which is required to meet state and federal surface water standards, and the impacts to the environment especially fish populations and water resources.  
The application is weak in understanding the geologic, legal and environmental ramifications of proposing this project in the Catskill Park and NYC Watershed.  The costs to develop the project in this protected, sensitive area would be astronomical. There should be assurance the company knows what it is getting into.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
Sincerely,

JoEllen Schermerhorn
