To whom it may concern at FERC:

I have deep concerns which I share with many fellow Empire Staters about the Ashokan Proposal to FERC for a Pumped Storage Add-On Project in the Catskill State Forest Preserve:
1.	Literally millions of New Yorkers including me and my family depend on water sourced from the Ashokan Reservoir System, and this water would likely be harmfully contaminated by the project’s operations.
2.	Quality of life for residents in the region would be adversely affected by the operation’s loud, jarring noise, with much area wildlife habitat damaged or destroyed in the process.  Air quality would also be greatly compromised, and the peace and natural beauty of the impacted area would be ruined for all.
3.	The region’s robust tourism industry, traditionally a win-win for both the Catskill’s communities and their legions of visitors, would take a huge hit, entailing not only much loss of gainful employment but also a permanently degraded environment—which I believe we all agree is absolutely priceless.

So I strongly urge all of you at FERC unhesitatingly to reject this project, P-15056, irrevocably. In doing so you’ll help preserve the well-being of entire NY communities as well as the health of the region’s precious natural heritage. You’ll also prevent possibly many costly years of litigation and distress for all involved.

Thank you for your serious consideration of my appeal.
David Vassar
