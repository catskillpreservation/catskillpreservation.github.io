I'm writing to let you know I oppose this project to build a hydro-electric plant above the Ashokan. I visit several friends in this area and value the wonderful beauty of this region. The project site is inside of Catskill Forest Preserve, and would destroy these highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. It could also have negative effects to the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s drinking water. It's a protected water source and this could  ​increase turbidity and pollution and affect people throughout the state. Finally, private property may need to be taken to build this. My friends have lived in the area for decades and have set up businesses and are actively contributing to the economic and cultural growth of this region. To have them potentially lose their land and all that they have worked for so that an out-of-state company can build something that may damage this protected land is heartbreaking. Please protect this natural environment and do not move forward with this project.

Thank you,
Laura Sitler
