As a long time resident of the town of Olive, N.Y., I am dismayed that a private electric company could invade, destroy, and usurp our land for their profit. 

This project would negatively impact the environment in far too may ways. It would impact the Esopus Creek, one of the premier trout fishing streams, with muddy turbidity also affecting the Ashokan Reservoir, a source of drinking water for  millions of people in NYC.  It would devastate local tourism for which this area is famous and dependent.

The Catskills are a State Preserve, protected by the state constitution.  Does this mean nothing in the face of money to be made?  How dare this company invade and destroy our environment?  Who are the politicians shilling for this company? I have worked for decades to protect pollinators in our area. The Scenic Byway, 52 miles of Route 28, has encouraged the towns along the By-way to protect pollinators and all wildlife.

This disruptive electric power and dam project is not how to move forward toward an equitable future mindful of climate change.  This project destroys and disrupts and should definitely not be approved.

Thank you.
