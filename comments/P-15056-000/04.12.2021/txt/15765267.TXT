I am a homeowner for 15 years on State Route 214 in the town of Phoenicia, NY.

Building green energy infrastructure is a necessary step for New York State but the proposed hydropower facility proposed in Project Docket:  P-15056 would harm water quality at Ashokan Reservoir which provides fresh clean water to approximately 3,600,000 people and add variables to, while potential disrupting, New York Cityâ€™s longstanding efforts to operate and protect the water supply. 

Not only could the hydroelectric plant contaminate the water quality, but building the infrastructure to service the energy production would put a strain on the protected wilderness of the Catskill region. The Catskill Forest Preserve is home to hiking, camping, fishing, skiing, and all other types of outdoor recreation that could be disrupted by large-scale energy projects.  It would disrupt recreation areas that were established more than a century ago and are now home to many species of threatened animals.

Thanks to the unfragmented forests we are able to be an area that's more resilient to climate change and also host a number of rare and endangered species.

I am sure there must be multiple locations with the same upside yet not having all the downsides.
