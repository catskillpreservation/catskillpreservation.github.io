I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Hydroelectric pumped storage facility that Premium Energy Holdings has proposed in the Catskill region of New York (P-15056-000), and to urge FERC to fully account for the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the flooding of forests within the Catskill Preserve. In addition to the negative impacts on species that depend on our forests, inundating these forests would cause methane to be released as vegetation decomposes. We must not inadvertently create more greenhouse gas emissions by building new hydropower facilities - and any accounting of their greenhouse gas emissions must include the lost carbon sequestration potential of the areas inundated. Forests are perhaps the best-known “nature-based solution” to climate change. We need to increase the area of forested land in our state, not decrease it. Before we resort to destroying vital natural areas like the forests and streams within the Catskill Preserve to create pumped hydropower energy storage, we should explore alternatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, like electric water heaters that can be turned on and off in response to the needs of the grid. Please reject this shortsighted proposal by Premium Energy Holdings, and prioritize real greenhouse gas emission reductions.
