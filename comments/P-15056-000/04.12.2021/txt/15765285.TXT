Hello

I'm opposed to the underground hydroelectric power station being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC.

One of the reasons my husband and I purchased our home in Olivebridge, NY is because we were interested in being near protected land.

The Catskill Forest Preserve has existed for 135 years and is highly significant to the ecosystem that it protects.  This project would be destroying highly persevered land and would be against the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. That designation, in and of itself, is reason enough not to allow this proposal to go through. Land designated as status 1 or 2 are not supposed to be developed in any way,

This proposal also goes against what the DoE says it wants - it wants to support closed-loop projects -  this is not.  

It’s an upper reservoir being added on to a lower reservoir - an "add-on” project.  They are not truthful in what they are proposing so don’t deserve FERC approval.

Thank you for your consideration.
