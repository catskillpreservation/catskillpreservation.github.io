I am commenting on the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. I looked at the proposal on the website, and it is very difficult, from the online documents, if one is not an engineer, to determine whether this would be good, or necessary, and how much it would impact the local residentâ€™s quality of life, the wildlife, or the ecological systems we all depend on. Therefore, I can not make a definitive comment either way regarding whether I would support or oppose this project. I can say this, though. The ecological balance is very delicate in this area of New York. The residents live here because of the natural beauty of the area. Any new engineering project should be considered and reconsidered extremely carefully to insure there would be minimal negative effects to the natural beauty of the area or the ecological balance. The quality of life is another factor to be considered. Should this project inconvenience or upset the daily routine of residents, that would be another reason to consider and reconsider this project. The residents of this area are largely poor or lower middle class, (although there is a fairly large group of wealthy people as well), and traffic jams, rerouting of travel, and other inconveniences of this type would present an economic disadvantage to many local residents. Thank you for reading and registering my comments.
