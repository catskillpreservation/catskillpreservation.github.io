We have choices for alternative energy resources often they require a balance between the need for protection of environments with seeking new energy development.   This project seems to be so ill conceived, so inappropriate to the setting, so damaging to the quality of the water supply (locally and for NYC), and so disruptive to local human communities that have historically suffered the loss of homes6 and villages to create the reservoir.  Premium Energy has questionable capacity to manage such a project and has no local connection - nor has it reached out to the relevant local officials or organizations for comment or advice to its plans.

Please deny this permit.  Weâ€™re at such a transformational time and the choices we make now will shape the realities of the next generations.

Thank you.
