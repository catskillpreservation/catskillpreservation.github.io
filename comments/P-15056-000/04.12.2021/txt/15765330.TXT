COMMENTS ON ASHOKAN RESERVOIR PROPOSED PUMPED STORAGE
HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY   P – 15056
April 12, 2021

I OPPOSE ASHOKAN RESERVOIR PUMP STORAGE PROPOSAL

As a resident of NYS, I have hiked and backpacked the region for over 50 years in these Catskill Forest Preserve wilderness and wild lands.  

I have supported the organizations that have taught us all respectful and safe use, and maintained and improved habitat protection and recreational access.  NYNJ Trail Conference, Adirondack Mountain Club, Catskill 3500 Club, and NYS DEC have done commendable work to protect this valuable resource in its wild state.

The value of these lands has only increased with more demand by the public.
  
The critical need to protect this NYC water source’s fine quality is essential.

ISSUE:  The pumped-storage proposal directly threatens the disruption and future degradation of quality of these lands for habitat, recreational and water quality maintenance. 
 
There are no safeguards to this project that could possibly satisfy the higher purposes of these lands. Forever wild.

THEREFORE, I URGE YOU TO REJECT THE PREMIER ENERGY HOLDINGS OF SOUTHERN CALLIFORNIA ASKOKAN APPLICATION.

Sincerely,
Mary Helen Crump
