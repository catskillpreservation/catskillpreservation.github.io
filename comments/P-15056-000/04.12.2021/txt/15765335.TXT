Dear Secretary Bose, et al.;

I am writing to voice my strong objection to the proposed "Ashokan Pumped Storage Project."

This project is nothing more than an abuse of government works programs, designed solely for the profit of an exploitative corporation. 

It should be clear from the previous endeavors and pursuits of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC that there is no tangible benefit from this project to the community or the interests of any community members. It should also be painfully clear that this company has no interest whatsoever in sustainably improving the infrastructure of any community. They are simply fishing for projects from which they might profit. 

The idea that this corporation should be allowed to disrupt not only the ecosystem of this region, but the supply of fresh drinking water for over 8 million people, for the sake of a handful of California-based entrepreneurs should be appalling to any of the area's citizens. The management team at Premium Energy Holdings knows very well that they are not adding value to this community, or to New York's green energy initiatives. 

While I am aware that Premium Energy Holdings has indicated that they will seek new sites or revise their plan, I still feel an urgent need to voice my opposition to this company and its practices. New York State, like every other state, is in desperate need of newer, greener infrastructure. The projects that comprise this infrastructure will need to be efficient, effective, and exacting. Hydroelectric plants that do little more than power themselves are a complete waste of tax payer's money, and of the precious little time that we have to curb carbon emissions. 

Please stop Premium Energy Holdings from building any projects anywhere in Ulster County or anywhere in New York State. New Yorkers can do it better, and we can do it in a way that benefits all New Yorkers.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Matthew Lange
