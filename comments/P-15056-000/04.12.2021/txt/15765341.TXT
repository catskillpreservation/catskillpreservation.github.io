My objection to the proposed application is based on:
the fact that as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered  
Status 1 land under USGS "Gap Analysis Program".  According to the Dept. of Energy's own Hydropower Vision, "areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development."  
The Catskill area provides 90% of NYC's water, a water supply that provides 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people.  The largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, built at the cost of displacing 25 communities.  40% of NYC's water passes through the Ashokan reservoir.  The pumped storage project is likely to increase the turbidity which would decrease the quality of NYC water.  
Then Route is one of only two roads that connect the Catskills' two major highways, Route 28 and Route 23A.  Any disruption to that road would inflict a heavy blow to the tourist economies of Hunter Mountain Resort and the town of Phoenicia, rated the #1 tourist destination outside of NYC.  Route 214 is designated a scenic byway and is part of the Mountain Clove Scenic Byway.  NYC DEP, Ulster County, and Greene County have all invested significant sums of money to reinforcing and improving Stony Clove Creek to improve stream ecology, reduction of flooding, reducing turbidity in the Ashokan reservoir, and maintaining the roads around the reservoirs.  
The investment in this project seems as though it will not garner the rewards that would justify the disruption to our ecology, economy, and personal lives to justify going forward.  
Thank you for your time and attention.  Sincerely, Isabel A D Bengtson
