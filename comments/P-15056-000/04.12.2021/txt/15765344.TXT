To Whom it may concern,

Thank you for the opportunity to voice my definite opposition to this project.

As a lifetime resident of New York, and a homeowner here in the Catskill park itself, it is incredibly evident and conclusive that this proposal is absurd when held under the looking glass of our state's legislation, pride in conservation, and legacy of preserving the wilds of the Catskills for future generations to come.

When something by definition causes more harm to an area it is proposing to help, it is already deemed a failure.

So is, in the opinion of this New York State Outdoor Guide, Eagle Scout and resident, any idea of exploiting the natural resources of this area for any purpose.

The Catskills does not need, nor can it bear, any future failures in terms of conservation.It's success environmentally depends on a fragile balance which is voiced by it's constituents and legislature which protects the park.

In this case, the silent voice of nature has also been vocalized by our representatives, scientists, and respected biologists.

And the mountains say "NO".
