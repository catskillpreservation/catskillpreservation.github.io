  My comments are in opposition to premium energy holdings LLC permit to do a feasibility study in the Catskill Park. I surely hope this office will see the flaws in this permit application.  Everything from the Ashokan reservior as a major source of NY city drinking water to the fact the Catskill Forrest Preserve has been designated wild forever.  I have been from a local farming family for 100 years.  Being a lifelong resident of this farming family I have witnessed our growing season becoming very unpredictable, especially in the last 10-15 years due to climate change.  I have watched the wildest fluxuations in our water cycles from no snow pack in the winter to serious flooding.  This is an open hydro system plan, extremes of these conditions are a threat to these plans, not to mention the threat to NYC water supply which obtains 40% of their drinking from the ashokan reservior.  This proposal will compound the problems our area already faces.  The town of Olive already has a shortage of housing.  Displaced local people will not be able to find local housing.  The catskill park has been designated wild forever, it is home to threatened species such as the box turtle to the wild three bird orchid. I personally have documented and registered a colony of over 600 three bird orchids on my land on Moonhaw road. this is one of only 6 in NYS. I hope FERC will seriously consider the impact of this proposal on this fragile and protected environment.  I believe there will be many new breakthroughs in energy production in the near future. Sincerely Jean Duffy
