Basis for Intervening:
The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.7 million members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places including water resources needed to sustain natural ecosystems. The Center supports the development of clean and renewable energy and needed energy storage to support such development, which is a critical component of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid the worst consequences of climate change, and assist the nation in meeting critical emission reduction goals.  However, like any energy project, proposed energy storage projects must be thoughtfully planned to minimize impacts to the environment and, in particular, avoid harming sensitive species, habitats and other critical resources including water resources.  The Center is concerned that the proposed Ashokan Project is poorly sited in an area with highly sensitive environmental resources and would adversely impact critical water resources.
