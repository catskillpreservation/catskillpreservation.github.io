To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to oppose the application for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  There are many reasons to oppose.  Here are just a couple.  First, we have other viable and less invasive energy sources available to us in 2021.  Solar and wind.  Second, the biggest concern is how much it would damage the environment immeasurably.  The Catskill Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest. Third, according to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.  

We need to be able to have a vote on such a big proposal that would affect all of our lives.

Thank you.
