Hello,
The plan submitted by premium energy will negatively impact the environmet permanently. The Catskills is already designated a forest preserve to right the wrong done by the tanning industry at the beginning of the 20th century. The forest is still coming back as second growth trees do we need to stress the plant life, animal life and the waters again?
As a home owner I have invested in this land and community. I vehemently object to a corporation from across the country with no vested interest in the land and the people setting up a for profit corporation under the guise of sustainable energy.

Best,
James
