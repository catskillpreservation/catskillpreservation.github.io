I own a home in the Woodland Valley area of Phoenicia, NY, one of the three alternative sites in Premium Energy’s application for a permit. If the proposed hydro-electric power station is built at this site, the location of the dam would make it impossible to gain access to my property.  While I obviously have a personal stake in opposing this project, this is not simply an example of “not in my backyard.” Rather, the construction and operation of a power station at the proposed sites would result in the destruction of protected public forests and streams, and threaten the integrity of New York City’s drinking water. 

The Woodland Valley site, and the other alternative sites, are all within the Catskill Forest Preserve, a unique national treasure, created in 1885, which was a blueprint for our national parks. It is protected by the New York State Constitution which mandates that it be kept “forever kept as wild forest lands.” The project, if permitted, would inexorably destroy protected forests, streams and wildlife within the preserve.  

The proposed sites are also inappropriate because they all contemplate that the newly-constructed reservoir would drain into the Ashokan reservoir, which provides 40 per cent of New York City’s drinking water. Particularly because the drinking water flowing from the Ashokan is unfiltered, the proposed project would present an intolerable threat to New York City’s water supply. 
    
For all of these reasons, I respectfully submit that the application should be summarily denied.
