I am writing to express my emphatic opposition to Premium Energy's proposal, and to urge FERC to deny the proposal.

ILLEGAL. New York State’s constitution (Article 14, section 1) expressly prohibits any development of the Catskill State Park land. Furthermore, the Catskill Preserve is exempt from eminent domain actions by the Federal Government. Therefore, Premium Energy’s proposal is a non-starter.

NOT CLOSED-LOOP. Premium Energy claims its project would be a “closed loop” system. This is not true. It is an “Add-on”. This company is being flagrantly dishonest in its proposal. Because this is not a closed loop project, Section 3004 of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 is not applicable here. Premium Energy is therefore disqualified from receiving expedited treatment in its application process; conversely, FERC has no basis to expedite Premium Energy’s application. Oddly, Premium Energy’s proposed timeline suggests it is expecting FERC to expedite it’s application process.

THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. The Ashokan Reservoir provides unfiltered drinking water to New York City. Premium Energy’s pumped energy storage project would escalate turbidity in the Ashokan to such an extent that disinfectants could seize to be effective and filtration would then be required. What would Premium Energy do if its operation tainted New York City’s unfiltered drinking water? What would the residents of New York City do?

It is as though Premium Energy is telling FERC it intends to break the law and it wants FERC to give it permission to proceed. Does FERC have authority to approve projects that it knows would be breaking the law?

I urge FERC to deny Premium Energy's proposal on these grounds. I have many additional concerns but will refrain at this point in time.

Thank you,

Eliott Peacock
