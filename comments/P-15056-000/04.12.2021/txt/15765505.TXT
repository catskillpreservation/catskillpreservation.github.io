FERC should deny this application on the basis that Premium Energy's proposed project would violate New York State's constitution (Article 14, section 1).

Furthermore, the Americaâ€™s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 does not give priority to projects such as these unless it is "Closed-Loop". Premium Energy's project would NOT be a "Closed-Loop" system, and FERC should treat its application accordingly.

This project poses high risks to environment, public health, ecology, and community. I urge FERC to deny Premium Energy's application. I would also like to request that FERC flag any proposals in the future where applicants intend to use lands that are protected by our state constitution. This would save everyone a lot of grief.

Thank you for considering these comments.
