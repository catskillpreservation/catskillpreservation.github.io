Please accept this comment in opposition to the proposed hydropower dam project. I have been a resident of Woodland Valley, NY for over 30 years and have hiked, backpacked and enjoyed the rivers, streams and trails of the Catskill State Forest Preserve for more than 50 years.  It is my understanding that these lands have been granted special legal protection both as part of the preserve and as the watershed for the New York City drinking water. The forest ecology should not be tampered with for energy infrastructure or generation facilities. The unique habitat accessible via the trailheads within Woodland valley should not be endangered by a project of questionable ecological and economic viability.  It is generally understood that a hydro project, as proposed, is actually a net user of energy and will unavoidably cause ecological degradation.  Pumping water uphill uses more electricity than it generates running downhill. The unique habitat in this section of the Forest Preserve, includes virgin timber stands and other flora, as well as habitat for diverse animals including raptors and bats. I am also a resident of New York City and object to this project because of the probability it will degrade the source of New York City’s unfiltered and world-renowned  drinking water.  The COVID pandemic has again revealed the importance of the Forest Preserve’s wilderness, providing recreational activities in a quiet, safe and clean environment.  The project will permanently de-grade and reduce access to the State Forest trail system and world-renowned fishing streams for short term energy production goals.    This is a time to reinforce not eliminate, the forever wild designation to allow access to this ecological gem for all of us now and in the future.
