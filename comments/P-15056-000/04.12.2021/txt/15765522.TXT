To whom it may concern

My family and I are outright against the proposed pumped hydro storage project in Greene and Ulster counties. 
I have lived in the Catskill Park in the Town of Hunter, for over 15 years and see the impact that increased visitors have on the trails and infrastructure of local towns. Creating fake landscapes is diluting and damaging to the identity of a world renowned Park. 
Many not for profit organizations for the Catskill Park diligently offer an educational experience for visitors and assist in strengthening and protecting our First American Park for the good of all.  We are the stewards of the land and protection of our fragile environment is paramount to curb unfavorable development here. As it stands today the Esopus runs brown with turbid waters from the out flow from the Ashokan reservoir having grave effects on spawning grounds of the trout. Now proposing upstream burying land and its natural identity by flooding, makes a false vista and environmental damages that no Hudson River painter ever would want to paint! Fix the existing abuse don’t do more. 
This is a vibrant park with bald eagle, bear, wood turtles and humans that love it and stand to protect its natural beauty. With ever intrusive urban sprawl and the unfathomable pressures for destruction of people’s lives in this delicate sense of place, I say no to this proposal. 
Yours sincerely 
Jane Burd
