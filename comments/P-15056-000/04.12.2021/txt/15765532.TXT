The proposed Ashokan Pump Station project is pure insanity.  

This naked, corporate land grab would decimate a large swath of our forever wild Catskills, destroy neighborhoods, blight the environment, harm wildlife, force people from their homes, drive down property values.  

One of America’s most unspoiled and beautiful regions would be exploited and ruined for private profit.

Additionally, New York City’s drinking water supply would be threatened. 

The fact that a proposal like this was allowed to get this far by the Federal government, without the awareness of the towns and entities that it would be endangering, is a travesty and should be investigated.

This project must not be allowed to go forward.
