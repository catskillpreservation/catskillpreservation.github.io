I would like to take this opportunity to point out that Premium Energy appears to be completely unware that they are proposing a project in and around an extremely protected state preserve, a Status 1, according to the USGS Gap Analysis. According to the Dept. of Energy's own "Hydropower Vision", "areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 are avoided for development". As a resident of Lanesville, where one of the resevoirs is proposed, I understand that a portion of the resevoire is on private land, but to that effect, the forest, which includes the rare wildlife that lives within these areas, cannot distinguish between what is state, and what is private land. The impacts of these resevoirs will wreak havoc on stream ecology and the habitats of both land and water wildlife. Please do not allow this study to proceed. We need to keep the Catskills Wild.
