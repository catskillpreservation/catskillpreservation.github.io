Oppose FERC project number P-15056

As a part-time resident of Woodland Valley, I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the proposal of a pumped storage hydro plant in the Catskills. Although finding green energy alternatives should be important for New York, the Catskills and NYC watershed are not appropriate areas for a pumped storage hydro project.

The proposed locations are not at all suitable for this project. This project would detrimentally impact highly protected areas of the Catskills, including the habitats of multiple protected species. The proposed locations would harm the habitat of plant, bat and snake species that are listed as either “threatened,” “special concern,” or “greatest conservation need.” Several bird and fish species, including trout and three hawk species, would also be greatly impacted by the location of this project.

The proposed areas of development are located within a protected state preserve protected by the state constitution to “be forever kept as wild forest lands.” The land management changes to the State Forest Preserve necessary to move forward with this project would require constitutional amendment, votes in two sessions in the state legislature, and submission for public referendum. The success rate for approving amendments through this process is close to 1%. The protections placed upon the Catskill Preserve were created to prevent a project like this, and to keep companies from exploiting state forests. The public will fight to preserve the wilderness of the Catskills and will not abide by the commercial exploitation of this protected land.
