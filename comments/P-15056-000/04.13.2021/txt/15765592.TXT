This unlawful proposal must be rejected from further consideration, in that it is not legal at its base application.  This proposal is in direct opposition to the New York State Constitution.  The proposed land use positions the reservoirs on New York State and private lands that have been designated to be 'forever wild' in establishing the Catskills Forest Preserve. The current proposal asserts that the reservoirs would sit 'adjacent' to the Catskill Forest Preserve, a lie Premium Energy Holdings is perpetrating to begin the next step of its study. Additionally, any reservoir would be devestational from an ecological and economic standpoint to all of the surrounding towns and villages.  The proposed land is status 1 habitat and some of the most unique ecology in all of the Northeast and the Catskills.  Additionally, Route 214 is a vital artery for Hunter and areas north.  None of this destruction is worth a proposal of energy arbitrage for a net 800MW of annual power.  Energy arbitrage is not green energy.  It is unfathomably catastrophic and would be economically devastating to land that provides New York City 40% of its drinking water and represents billions of dollars of tourism for the region.  Please reject this proposal for these reasons and the many similar submissions you have, no doubt, received.
