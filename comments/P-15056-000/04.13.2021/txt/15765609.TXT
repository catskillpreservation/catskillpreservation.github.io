Premium Energy entirely ignores the fact that the proposal impacts protected land within the Catskill Forest Preserve. Whether a gross oversight or a willful one, this land is protected by law within the New York State Constitution. As a lifelong resident of the Woodland Valley, I can assert that the land there is precious not only to the wild, at risk, and endangered animal and plant species that dwell within it but also to the hikers, hunters and artists who inhabit it. Those humans are well positioned and well armed with social media, historical data, and righteous conservatism to do their part to protect lands that “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands” and “shall not be sold, nor shall they be leased or taken by any person or corporation, public or private" as decreed in Article 14, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution in 1894. 

Thank you,
