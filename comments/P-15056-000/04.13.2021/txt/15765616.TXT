I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
Please do not allow money interests to interfere with the nature in the Catskills.  It is irreplaceable.  To allow this company to build will devastate the region.  This is not necessary.  Please decline the request.
Sincerely,
CS Riedel
