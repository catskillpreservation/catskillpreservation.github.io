I am writing in opposition to the pending permit application.  I write as a new retiree drawn to the region and a resident one mile from the Ashokan Reservoir, for its heritage of land protection, watershed conservation and the promise of no development within its protected waters.  I am not an engineer but I have worked in the public sector for 40 years.  The proposal seems rushed, full of negative impacts to the surrounding communities, disruptive to wildlife, human life and the fresh water sources it would seek to draw energy from.  These lands are cherished for good reason and the last thing needed is a damned reservior, an underground hydro plant with transmission lines running from the town of Olive, to Ulster.  

While recent news indicates a portion of the proposal has been withdrawn, we as residents have no direct information or contact and we are the people most impacted by the massive project.

I join my neighbors and town officials in registering strenuous opposition.
Thank you,

Lester Burg
