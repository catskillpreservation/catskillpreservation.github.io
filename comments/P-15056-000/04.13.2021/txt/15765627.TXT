FERC PROJECT NUMBER P-15056:000
The purpose of this comment is to express dissatisfaction of the Premium Energy's proposed Pump Hydro Project P-15056.
Premium Energyâ€™s proposed pump storage project in Ashokan, New York would be highly damaging to the Catskill Forest Preserve. New construction in any scale is extremely impactful on the natural fauna and flora. As a young project engineer for a mid-size commercial construction company, I have seen first-hand the destruction and pollution that occurs on the landscape over the course of an 18 - 24-month project. Silt fences are never maintained properly, and personal trash/waste materials are thrown across the site with any amount of wind. The littered trash alone of project of this size and duration would react havoc on delicate ecosystem that is the Catskill Forest Preserve and New York City Watershed. It appears that Premium Energy is unaware of the existing protections that are in place at the proposed location of their upper reservoir.
