I'm a resident of the Hudson Valley & active user of the beautiful Catskill Forest Preserve. The NYS Constitution clearly states these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Everything proposed falls within the limits of this State Forest Preserve. Impacting its natural beauty would be a shortsighted decision with significant negative impacts, both environmental & economic.

Tourism plays an integral role is the ongoing Catskill rebirth. It’s a billion plus dollar industry supporting tens of thousands of jobs. Limiting a major thoroughfare to popular hikes & towns would be a detriment to the local economy. Not to mention the impact on local homeowners and non-resident second homeowners, or the risk posed to a water source supplying billions of gallons a day to NYC.

I believe this “add-on” project should be rejected outright. I support alternative paths to a clean future, driven by local investment, not anonymous corporations from across the country.
