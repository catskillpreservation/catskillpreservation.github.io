Comment regarding docket number P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose,

The Catskill Park in New York contains an enormous network of streams and creeks, many of which lead into the Ashokan Reservoir at its Southernmost point. Not only would Premium Energyâ€™s proposed plant gut the ecosystems surrounding the pumping system but inevitably it would destroy the last of the struggling native Trout population in adjacent water bodies. The system outlined is not, in fact, a closed loop system. There are hundreds of tributaries to the Espous within each outlined potential upper reservoir site and the wild animals that live in this state protected land would suffer from wildly unnatural water levels and turbidity. 

Please consider rejecting this application on the grounds that it does not comprise a closed loop system and would have dire consequences for the surrounding ecosystems that are protected by the New York State constitution.

Sincerely,

Jason Kachadourian
