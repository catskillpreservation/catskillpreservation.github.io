To whom it may concern,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

I am concerned about this project's impact on our local community and the Catskills Forest Preserve. I fear that this system will have a great negative impact on both land and aquatic habitats. 

Here in the Catskills we have a wonderful community wherein the residents respect nature and the nature provides us with resources and recreation. This project would offset that balance and destroy our community.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
