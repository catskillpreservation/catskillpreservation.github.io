I am a resident of Olivebridge, NY and I OPPOSE the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. It is too costly of a project, creating upheaval to human lives (homes, jobs, overall welfare of established communities) and to the animal, plant, and geological ecosystems upon which the health of our communities rely.
