I am posting in opposition of the Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant (the FERC project number, P-15056) proposal.  The preservation of wildlife habitats is already in jeopardy and it remains paramount that vital lands remain protected to support and maintain their ecosystems.  Not only does a reservoir threaten to destroy land habitats, but it also threatens to destroy important and vital aquatic habitats as well.
