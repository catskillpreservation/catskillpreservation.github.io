Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

I spend my summers by the Ashokan Reservoir and have gotten to know the communities that surround this area. I have been under the impression that the these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands and they shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” This is what makes the area so bucolic and unique. I am befuddled that this proposal has gotten so far. 

The damage that this proposal would cause to the natural habitat and the residents is far greater than the positive impact. The facts are on the table. The data is out there.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Thank you very much,
Arden Sherman
