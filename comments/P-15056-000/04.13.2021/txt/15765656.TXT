Please reject the preliminary permit application from Premium Energy to construct a pumped storage hydro project in the Catskills Forest Preserve.

All three proposed locations of the upper reservoir for the project will adversely affect wildlife habitats for birds, fish, and flora; many of which are protected in New York State.

The construction of dams, tunnels, roads, buildings and transmission lines within the immediate project boundaries and surrounding areas will harm the ecology of the land and water immeasurably. Trout breeding waters, bird habitats, and the New York City water supply all will suffer. 

Premium Energy, a California company, may be unaware of the protected designation of the Catskills Forest Preserve. The Preserve is protected from development by the NY State constitution and must “be forever kept as wild forest lands” and may not be sold or leased for any development public or private.
