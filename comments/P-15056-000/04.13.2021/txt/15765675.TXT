I'm writing today to express my opposition to Premium Energy's proposal to build a dam at the end of Moonhaw Road and neighboring sites. I am a New York City resident who has developed a relationship with this area of the Catskills through close friends who are year-round residents. I have a deep respect and appreciation for the Catskills Forest Preserve. The proposed plan would lead to the destruction of this wildlife habitat. This land is supposed to be protected. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands â€œshall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private." Premium Energy should not be given permission to wreak havoc on the land, water, and wildlife of this area.
