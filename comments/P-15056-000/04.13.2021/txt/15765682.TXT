This application was made with absolutely no notice to the communities involved, with no apparent understanding of the sensitive nature of the environment, nor any understanding of the political and cultural issues that would result from flooding still more of the land in those communities.

This is a foolhardy proposal, endangering the water supply to New York City, and opening the still-raw wounds resulting from the loss of many communities to create the Ashokan Reservoir.

The surreptitious way in which it has begun indicates the developers know it will never win approval. It should be denied before any taxpayer dollars are wasted.
