As a resident of the local area I am not in favor of this proposal. I was shocked to read of this proposal that seems to have appeared with no warning or input from the local authorities or from the DEP. It appears poorly conceived, badly thought out, and hurriedly submitted. Perhaps most important it significantly affects permanently protected land. Further, it looks as if it could have serious negative impacts on local wildlife and the environment, including nearby underground aquafiers and wells. This is absolutely the wrong type of project for this area.
