Dear Ms. Bose,

I hope my letter does not find you too late. Being from Olivebridge, I am grateful to hold the Catskill ecosystem in high regard. My summers are spent swimming in the local streams, and my winters by walks in the undisrupted forests. I am indebted to the individuals who are spreading awareness of the importance of preserving the streams, wildlife, and beauty of the Catskills. 

The hydroelectric power plant proposal by Premium Energy Holdings is extremely concerning to me, and to the locals of the area. This environment is resilient, but not bulletproof. I urge you, your team, and the companies of interest to reflect on what is of the most ecologic and long-term sense. 

The Catskills are luckily preserved land – this protective legal action (Article XIV of NYS Constitution) is hopefully on the forefront of your mind. It is laws like this that help protect important wildlife habitats from the wants of short-term business incentives. While the Catskill locals appreciate the importance of renewable energy sources, it must be made clear that not all “renewable” sources are environmentally friendly. The Catskills, and New York City water supplies and livelihoods, would suffer from this proposal. There are other solutions that would be less disruptive – this is not a closed-loop project.

I truly hope FERC listens to the public and professional protests to the proposed pump storage hydroelectric plant. I’ll keep my letter on the shorter side, as I’m aware that over 1,000 individuals have reached out with strong points in opposition to Project P-15056. I stress the importance of this cause and hope by reading our letters and hearing our voices you will deny P-15056.

Sincerely,
Correy McGlyn
