As a resident of Olive NY, I'm strongly opposed to this proposal! Preserving the natural woodlands, streams and ecology of this region is extremely important. This land offers a habitat for wildlife, especially birds. The Audubon Society has designated this land "a distinctive sub-alpine bird community", which includes one of the largest contiguous forest tracks in New York State. The fact that this natural habitat is "contiguous" is very important, because the proposal by Premium Energy holdings would cause man-made disruptions that would render the land no longer contiguous. That would disrupt ability of wildlife to have sufficient mobility for their life cycles, including mating, foraging, nesting, and so on.

Furthermore, my understanding is that the Catskills are a State Forest Preserve, granted a "Status 1" label by the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the US Department of Energy, development should be avoided in these areas. 

In addition to that, I'm very concerned about the impact of this proposal to the stream ecology of this area. It's essential for the trout in this area to have uninterrupted life-cycles. The trout are necessary for a balanced ecosystem and also help with tourism in the area as well. There would be several significant disruptions from the "pumped water" system of this hydroelectric project, including altering the sediment levels in the water and causing rapid fluctuations in the water levels.

To summarize, in my viewpoint this hydroelectric proposal will do major damage to a precious and vulnerable ecosystem. As a local resident, I feel a moral duty to protect this land from the massive disruption and long-term negative consequences this project would cause.
