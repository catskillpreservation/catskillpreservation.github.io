As an electric power engineer that is intimately involved in the NY CLCPA goals of interconnecting renewable energy in New York State, I am adamantly opposed to this proposed pumped hydro plant. Increasing the amount of solar generation  paired with battery storage is a more technologically advanced strategy than the high-maintenance, outdated technology being proposed. This is not the type of renewable resource that is needed in New York State. While reservoirs, such as the extant Ashokan, seem like prime candidates for pumped hydro, the infrastructure that is required at the higher elevation does not exist. The construction of the required infrastructure would be damaging to the wild nature of our beloved Catskill Mountains. The Catskills are littered with ruins of ill-conceived business ventures from bygone eras - let's not add another that future generations will shamefully look upon.
