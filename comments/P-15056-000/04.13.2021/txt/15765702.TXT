I am strongly against this project due to the impact of Proposed High voltage transmission lines directly impacting the natural beauty and reason for visiting the area along Rt 28, and newly constructed Rail Trail nature immersion and views and vistas that are will negatively impact ego tourism and the ability for local residents who moved to the area within 15 miles of power lines to specifically enjoy the lack of transmission allow local open Ashokan reservoir vistas routes.   
Strongly against this project, as will destroy innate natures attraction to area and have a longer-term negative impact on local home prices as well.
