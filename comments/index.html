The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is deeply flawed. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

The watershed area is also a critical source of drinking water for the City of New York.  Planning for double use of this water is risky for the reliability of both the drinking water and for energy planning.
The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

The proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city.

I urge FERC to decline this request.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Pip Merrick under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>pip merrick, phoenicia, NY.

The Premium proposal states that excess water from the proposed upper reservoir ( Woodland Valley) would be discharged to the Woodland Creek.  I am concerned  this &#39;excess of water&#39; could tragically impact the area during a  flood. 

 Could you tell me the quantity of water that Premium intends to  discharge per hour?

There have been 11 major floods between 1933 and 2011.  I have lived in Phoenicia and witnessed the floods of 1980.1987,2005, 2010,2011.

In the spring of 1980 I was renting a house on the Esopus and watched as the water flowed over the nearby bridge.  When I returned to my house, water had filled 2 feet of the first floor.

In the fall of 2011, I was interested in buying a house on the Esopus.  During the flood a picture was taken. The house was enveloped in water with only the chimney sticking out.  Of course, the house was ruined and the property lost the backyard to the Esopus. 

I doesn&#39;t take much imagination to recognize that if a large body of water increases in size due to quick spring thaws, days of rain, hurricanes,etc, the discharge from the reservoir will add to the flooding problems of the already swollen tributaries.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Patricia Reed under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am deeply disturbed by the proposal Premium Energy Holdings has made to build a hydroelectric power plant, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, in New York’s Catskill Mountains. This would be a devastating assault on the environment, on personal properties, on the exquisite way of life The Catskills offer, and on NYC drinking water. It is completely unacceptable I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit.

I’m certain you have received numerous science-based reports detailing the negative effects of a project like this one so I will not repeat what has been submitted. As a resident of the area I am disgusted by even the idea that a company would ravage these beautiful Catskill Mountains, displace homeowners, and ignore the will of the people all for monetary gain.
 
We are at an important juncture in our life on this planet and if companies do not start making better, ecological and ethical decisions in how they conduct business this planet will not survive, and neither will my grandchildren. 

We must transition to renewable, green-energy sources. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

It&#39;s in your hands Ms. Bose! Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Hello,
I am writing today as a very concerned resident of New York State. The proposal to build a dam, reservoir and hydro electric power plant in the Catskills Forest Preserve is a dangerous and unwelcome project. It would effect the surrounding area and eco system of the Hudson Valley in a very scary way not to mention risk community displacement for folks living on private property near the proposed dam/plant. It would also directly effect the NYC water supply to over 9.5 million residents. As someone who has spent his whole life in the state of New York admiring its beauty and resilience I can’t help but feel I must speak up against any injustice that would be done to this state and it’s natural wonder. This proposal is dangerous and risky and should not be approved. I hope you hear our pleas and reject it.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Being a resident of both New York City and West Shokan, I stand in firm opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ ill-conceived proposal for a Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 15056 - a proposal which would have a serious negative impact on both communities.  

The Ashokan Reservoir was built over 100 years ago for the sole purpose of providing drinking water for NYC and now provides 40% of the drinking water for its 9.5 million people.  Subsequently, the streams that flow into it are strictly monitored and protected, as are the surrounding lands and forests so as not to disrupt NYC’s water quality and quantity.  Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a hydroelectric pump station in the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir would violate strict regulations of the surrounding land and water use.  It would increase turbidity in both the streams and reservoir, thus negatively impacting the drinking water for over  9.5  million people in the City of New York. 


The building of this reservoir over 100 years ago destroyed 12 towns and displaced 1000’s of people.  Now, Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a hydroelectric pump station in the Ashokan Reservoir, along with tunnels, dams, turbines and additional reservoirs, would again displace and/or destroy surrounding communities, as well as destroy parts of the Catskill Forest Preserves.  The Catskill Forest Preserves are protected by New York State and considered as Status #1 land.  Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Any change in land management of  the Catskill Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. This, in itself, should prove how seriously ill-conceived and flawed this proposal by Premium Energy Holdings is.

The massive underground installations and tunnel boring would undoubtedly affect the aquifers that provide the locality with drinking water. The high voltage towers that are planned to carry 230,00 volts of electricity to the grid would traverse even more of the local forest preserve, disrupting a long path of private property to link to the grid. What are the health effects of this high voltage on the local populace?


Additionally, with climate change, we have already been witnessing frequent drought conditions in the upper basin of the Ashokan, therefore already rendering unreliable the amount of water available just to adequately meet NYC’s needs which is the primary and sole purpose for the existence of the Ashokan Reservoir in the first place.  Building a hydroelectric pump station would compete for usage of the same water supplying NYC and would subsequently be an additional strain on the system.  This would result in both systems being seriously compromised and rendered incapable of performing the functions they were meant to fulfill. 

Sustainable and renewable energy is important, but it must be done with a smart, well researched,  and well considered plan.  This plan is ill-conceived and full of outrageous assumptions and serious flaws not mentioned here.  

We urge you to do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward and deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-1.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Thomas Efinger under P-15056.

I live in the town of Fleischmanns and frequently hike

I am strongly in favor of renewable energy and recognize
that we will need to increase our ability to store excess

that pumped storage facilities, like the one proposed, are
net energy consumers and can cause significant changes
to the environment and ecosystems in which they are sited.

For this reason, there must be a compelling reason to locate
a Pumped Storage facility in an environmentally sensitive region.

The proposed site is in a region that is:

Part of one of the largest State parks in NY.
Part of one of the best Trout fishing regions in NY state.
Part of the Drinking water system for NYC and other towns
Part of one of the best locations for outdoor activity (Hunting, Hiking, Skiing) in NY state.

I see no reason why this permit should be approved before the company
has shown that there are no sites where a Pumped storage facility
could be located that are less environmentally sensitive.

I am writing this letter to object to the issuance of a permit for the plan proposed by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC to the FERC Project No. 15056-000 .
While I am a proponent of the government investing in infrastructure as has been done successfully in the past, I feel that this plan is ill conceived and will be a great detriment to the Catskill Forest Preserve and Watershed Management area which is protected by the NYS constitution.  It will take the well being of this valuable wild resource for the profit of a power company which will be able to sell power at times of high demand for more money while damaging the Catskill Mountains.  The Catskill Mountains are one of the few wild places remaining in the crowded North East, within easy reach of NYC and other populated areas.  The Catskills provide recreation for many users and are protected by the NYS Constitution. 
The proposed application is described in paragraph two of the proposed application “AS A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM”   “EXHIBIT 1”  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT”  and sworn to by Victor Rojas Managing Director of Premium Energy LLC as follows “Being duly sworn, deposes, and says that the contents of this application for a preliminary permit are true to the best of his knowledge or belief. The undersigned applicant has signed the application on this 18th day of November of 2020”    
As described by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy“ A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM IS ONE WHERE THE RESERVOIRS ARE NOT CONNECTED TO A NATURAL BODY OF WATER”.  This is not the case as the system described in the proposed plan for FERC Project number 15056-000 since it includes impounding of water from the Stone Clove Creek and other creeks included in the proposal. It supports native Brook Trout as well as rainbow trout.  The Catskills cover 5892 square miles and the Stoney Clove Creek is 10.3 miles long and drains a basin of 32.4 square miles, hardly a closed system as described by Premium Energy Corporation.
The basic concept of this project is misrepresented and certainly doesn’t instill confidence in Premium Energy LLC or in the projects for which they are making application.  
Furthermore as I read the New York State Constitution Article XIV clearly states as follows
“The Constitution of the State of New York
ARTICLE XIV 
CONSERVATION
[Forest preserve to be forever kept wild; authorized uses and exceptions] 
Section 1. The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”
The proposal is very vague and incomplete.
I object strenuously to the lack of time allowed for public comment.  By the time I became aware of the project more than half of the allowable comment period had expired.  Others with whom I have spoken were also unaware of the project for more than half of the sixty days allotted for comments.  
As I reviews the project information that was available to me I found it woefully inadequate.  It took significant time for me to locate for example, where the location of the dam to impound the Stoney Clove Creek was to be located.  All mention in the plans to headrace tunnels, surge shafts, horizontal tunnels, penstocks and tailrace tunnels cannot be located on top maps and for the general public it is not obvious even if these areas will be laid bare to build tunnels or power houses or if they will be built from underground by boring tunnels.  No mention is made as to where debris such as demolished homes removed and earth and rock removed will be disposed.   
No mention is made in the proposal of the economic and social damage that will result in the area.
There is also no discussion as to anticipated  damage to the environment,  the local population, home owners and recreational users who come from large surrounding areas including but not limited to NYC, Long Island New Jersey.  
Even after reading everything I could find I still don’t know it the streams involved will be totally eliminated by impounding water which will subsequently be removed through tunnels to drive electric turbines and disappear to someplace down stream to be piped back up to the upper reservoir.  
We are all aware of the value of clean fresh water, and although the water to be used for generation of power will still be available for domestic use in NYC, it will not any longer be available for fish breeding or fishing or other recreational uses.     

I have seen over many years the flooding and soil erosion increase in the Catskills.  It has accelerated significantly in recent years.  It appears this pattern will continue to increase in the future.  If these streams are to rise and fall depending on generation schedules we can easily anticipate more siltation of the water in these streams, which will degrade the waters as fish habitat over larger areas than the immediate construction and be detrimental to the water quality itself perhaps even require NYC to require filtration, a process that have been trying to avoid for years
The Catskills is an especially unique place being that it is a wild and beautiful mountainous area close to large metropolitan areas and is used in many ways by numerous recreational users.  We would be wise to foster that recreational use in the Catskills rather than disturb it and discourage recreational use.
We have far too few wild places and wild streams, especially in the East.   Keeping the Catskills in its natural state is a worthwhile effort and we should not dam any wild streams in those few locations where they still exist.  Saving the Catskills is more important than this effort at making money for the power company and a misguided effort to reduce carbon emissions in this way.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I&#39;m reaching out to express my concern with the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to DECLINE their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it will not only devastate the area&#39;s vibrant natural environment, but will also be highly disruptive to local communities, and risk the purity of New York City’s drinking water.

As a former resident of the area, I&#39;m greatly concerned with its well-being. While pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will undoubtedly play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country. This cannot happen!

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

  I believe that the Ashokan Pump Storage Project is a bad idea.  The Catksills are a state preserve protected by the NYS Constitution.  Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution the lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation public or private.&#34;  The pump storage project would violate this article.            

This project would flood bird and wildlife habitats.  The rapid fluctuation of water will destroy aquatic and land habitats.  Trout breeding habitats, for example, will be lost.

This project will negatively impact tourism which is an integral part of our economy.  Tourism is a $1.6 BILLION dollar industry which provides almost 20,000 jobs.  Ulster County represents 43% of that market.

In addition to the above, over 100 years ago our valleys were flooded.  Businesses were destroyed, homes and farms were destroyed, families were torn apart, and numerous towns disappeared from the face of the earth.  The history of our area was erased.  Now, they want to do it again.  It is time for the rape of the Catskills to stop</pre><hr><b>Comments of Barry Price under P-15056.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
As a taxpayer, Architect and environmentalist I strongly oppose a project that remains unclear in terms of its intent and any transparency about long term benefits relative to near term disturbance to natural landscapes.
The project at best is confusing and unclear in intent.  I welcome dialogue about compromise and cost/benefit considerations, but not at the expense of clarity about intent, full disclosure and acknowledgement of the environmental sacrifice.  On the basis of how the project was introduced to the public alone, I reject it and its sponsors for the carelessness of its introduction.  If this is any indication, I fear for the worst in the execution and administration of the project.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

Re:  Premium Energy California Corporation plan to flood and create a water storage dam in Woodland Valley Phoenicia NY 12464

Folks:

As a long time 20&#43; year resident of Woodland Valley and the owner of two homes there...one for our grand children and the other for our children...we register our strong objections to this proposal.  Our family has had a presence in the Catskills for over a century.

This Company...apparently unfamiliar with and unknown to our local community...is hunting for a site and has proposed several I believe.  I also think they are merely on a &#34;fishing expedition&#34; to locate the &#34;least objectionable&#34; site with the least objections locally...which seems a very unsound and unscientific way to do things.

Woodland Valley is a pristine part of the larger Catskill Preserve and NYC/NYS Watershed areas.  As such it provides much needed and valued recreational opportunities such as camping.fishing, swimming, tubing, hiking, biking and simply communing with nature and meditating.

The negative impact on people...some of whom will lose their homes, lose access to historic and recreational sites, see the water table and stream systems altered and destroyed...will only be matched by the negative impact on the abundant wildlife, which includes bears, turkeys, deer, rabbits, ducks, trout, bass and countless others.

We humbly beg that you not allow this to happen!

Comments of Wendy Wolfenson regarding Premium Energy’s Proposal for the
Ashokan Reservoir Pumped Storage Project

Docket: P-15056

April 8, 2021

I am respectfully requesting that FERC deny the application of Premium Energy in the above-referenced project.  

Premium Energy has clearly not given this project the attention that it deserves, as evidenced by the numerous errors and omissions that pervade both the original and amended applications for a permit.

Please note just some of these mistakes:

1)	There is no “Shokan City,” “West Shokan Town,” or “Olivebridge Town.” The fact that Premium has gotten so many of the locations of its project incorrect suggests either incompetence or indifference to the affected communities.  These errors, either deliberate or accidental, have delayed the ability of the local municipalities to alert their citizens in a timely way.  Through incorrect addressing by Premium, the time in which officials and citizens could prepare their responses was also wrongly shortened.  Compelling Premium to correct these errors and resubmit its application would provide the municipalities and citizens with the comment period they are supposed to have during the permit application review process.

2)	Using Hudson Valley One as a means of satisfying the requirement to inform the public is inadequate.  Hudson Valley One is a weekly newspaper that is not widely circulated in the affected areas.  Its focus is on the more urban areas of Ulster County, such as Kingston, New Paltz, Woodstock and Saugerties.  By contrast, the Daily Freeman has a much larger circulation in the rural parts of the county and also includes Greene County in its base.

3)	 By failing to inform all the municipalities in a timely way, if FERC approves this application now, they are denying elderly citizens their right to become informed, file as intervenors, and comment at this stage.  Due to Covid-19, the normal process of face-to-face town meetings has been impossible.  As a result, many towns have tried to get the word out about this project through Zoom meetings and websites.  Since many of the elderly residents are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with these means of communication, the elderly are less likely to participate fully in this process.  Consequently, in order to protect the rights of the elderly, every aspect of timely notification should be enforced.


4)	There is no mention of the tunneling under private property that would be required as part of the plan.  It is unclear what damage to home foundations and wells this would cause or whether Premium even has the right to do this, absent the consent of the landowners.  Without the tunnels, the project is not buildable.  To approve the permit at this juncture, without resolving this issue in advance, allows Premium Energy to effectively “land bank” for years, without the possibility of successful completion.

5)	There is no mention of the Bushkill Cemetery, which exists within 300 feet of the access road to the upper Wittenberg reservoir (Moonhaw Road).  How does Premium Energy intend to protect the graves on this site during a lengthy construction period?  Many of these graves were actually moved from their original location, underneath the Ashokan Reservoir, when that reservoir was built over 100 years ago.  Are the graves supposed to be moved a second time or disturbed for years by countless heavy-duty construction vehicles?

6)	Premium states the high-voltage high-tension wires would run 12.9 miles.  This measurement is actually a straight line, as the crow flies, It would mean running these wires across the Ashokan Reservoir itself, which is an impossible scenario.  The actual running distance from the Hydro Plant in West Shokan to the Hurley Substation is closer to 20 miles.  This means that the use of these unsightly and potentially dangerous wires and towers is roughly 50% more than Premium states in the application.

7)	There is no indication of how Premium intends to obtain the property to build the miles of high-tension power lines.  Specifically, Premium does not disclose whether they will be putting these lines on New York City property, taking additional private land by Eminent Domain, or insisting instead that people in residential and protected areas will simply be forced to live with these eyesores and potential dangers on their property or near their homes.

8)	Premium Energy failed to address the potential for flooding in the project area.  They should be compelled to do a thorough FEMA review and mitigation plan.  The area around the proposed Wittenberg Reservoir is so flood-prone, that Federally subsidized flood insurance is required in order to obtain a mortgage.  The impact of spillage from the upper reservoir in times of excessive rainfall could be life-threatening to downstream residents. 

9)	 In its resubmission, Premium Energy said that “soil and rock borings will be necessary to determine the rock/soil structure and stability for the proposed dams and power plants foundations.  Soil and rock samples shall be extracted to conduct studies and determine the soil mechanical properties.”  Premium Energy does not explain how it will obtain these necessary samples, or even obtain permission to cross private land to get to New York State land.  At this juncture, it has become abundantly clear that the local landowners are vigorously opposed to the project and have no intention of cooperating with Premium Energy.
 

This project is clearly opposed by all the different communities and stakeholders.  Out of over 600 comments so far, there are only 2 that support it.  With a community-wide disapproval of over 99 ½%, and evidence of incompetence on the part of the applicant in so many areas, large and small, FERC, as the public’s Energy Regulatory defender and overseer, needs to put a stop to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project immediately.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lisa Phillips under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lisa Phillips, Woodstock, NY.


Premium Energy has submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that seeks permission to do a feasibility study that would clarify the project’s scope and viability. This is an inappropriate project that threatens the environmental and economic viability of our region. 

The project’s proximity to the Catskills is of great concern, as the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The project would also increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water. I’m also worried that the project would displace residents. My understanding is that the Ashokan watershed agreement limits development to keep the watershed safe. This has shaped the character of our region. It’s incomprehensible that a project on such a scale would even be possible, given the need to protect the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers. 

Please do not allow Premium Energy to move forward with this plan.

To whom it may concern, 

As a resident of West Shokan and New York City, I am extremely troubled by FERC’s proposal. In addition to our home in the town of Olive, we have two long-term residents who would be displaced by the proposal in a community that is already experiencing a housing shortage. Not to mention the disruption to the economy and local tourism that such a project would cause.  Even more concerningly is the long-term negative impact it would have on the ecosystem, aquatic and land habitats, and certain loss of habitat for innumerable species. Disruption to the water supply feeding the Ashokan reservoir would also impact a critical drinking water supply for both local residents (well water) and for New York City. 

The  Catskills are a State Preserve and protected by the NY State Constitution. Under Article XIV of the NYS ConsItuIon, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Furthermore, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protectIons designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

This plan is seriously flawed, does not appear to be well thought out, and should not be allowed to move forward.

The initial permit application, as well as the amended version, clearly demonstrate that Premium Energy has not performed even the minimum due diligence that is required for the application. It brings to question their ability to safely construct a dam that is over 300 feet tall and upstream of many homes. 

Following are a few of the many deficiencies found in the Premium Energy Holdings Ashokan Pumped Storage Project Preliminary Permit Application.

County, City, Town, Or Similar Local Political Subdivision Not Identified

Premium Energy has not identified every county, city, town, or similar local political subdivision in which any part of the project would be located, including names and mailing addresses, as must be provided for a preliminary permit application by Sections 4.32(a)(2)(i) and 4.32(a)(2)(ii).

The proposed Stony Clove reservoir would be located in the hamlet of Lanesville, NY, in the Town of Hunter, NY which is located in Greene County. None of these are identified, nor is a mailing address provided in the Permit Application.

In addition, high voltage transmission lines will pass through the towns of Marbletown and Hurley. These, too, are not identified in the Permit Application.

The application cannot be considered complete and must be considered deficient unless it includes all of the political subdivisions in which the project is proposed to be constructed as well as “Every other political subdivision in the project area that would likely be interested in or affected by the application.” (FERC Checklist For Applications For Preliminary Permits, item II(D) and 4.32). All of the above listed towns, political subdivisions and Greene County are not listed in the application, are those in which the project would be located and are required to be provided under Section 4.32, if not, the application must be rejected.

Non-existent City, Town, Or Similar Local Political in Application

Page five of the Permit Application states that the proposed project is located in Ulster County, New York. While this is correct for two of the proposed upper reservoir locations, the proposed Stony Clove reservoir is located in Greene County, New York.

Page five of the Application also states that the project is located in the Township, or nearby towns of Shokan City and West Hurley City, neither of these exist. 

It is reasonable to expect that Premium Energy is able to identify, and correctly name, all of the politico subdivisions and towns in which they propose to construct this project in their application. By using non-existent names, the application does not identify every city, town, or similar local political subdivision in which any part of the project would be used or located, as required by Sections 4.32 and 4.81 and is required to be rejected.

Lack of Emergency Spillway Description

FERC’s deficiency letter states that Exhibit 1 of the application does not mention any emergency spillways for the upper reservoirs. 
Premium Energy provides a wholly inadequate response, which does not address emergency spillways: “The new upper reservoir alternatives site would naturally discharge runoff water through its own concrete spillways to the existing streams which would be impounded.”  Premium Energy states information about emergency spillways has been included in Exhibit 1 of the amended application, it has not.

Exhibit 1 of the amended application  does not mention any emergency spillway or contain a description for any emergency spillway, to any extent, at any of the proposed reservoir sites, including at a minimum number, dimensions and general configuration of the emergency spillways, as required by Section 4.81(b)(1). FERC’s noted deficiency has not been addressed, resulting in the application remaining deficient. 

Inadequate Maps

FERC’s deficiency letter states the maps do not meet the requirements of Section 4.81(d)(5) “You provide the series of maps for the project layout.  However, the scale of maps is not sufficient to show clearly and legibly all of the information.  Please revise and submit the maps enlarged to a scale that is adequate for that purpose.” Premium Energy responds that a new series of maps for the project layout is provided in Exhibit 3.

A review of the maps in both the original and amended applications shows that a few maps have been added. The scale of the original maps has not been changed, the scale of the new maps is also not sufficient to show the required information clearly and legibly. The maps also lack detail and notations which makes them inadequate properly show information required by Section 4.81 to be provided in Exhibit 3 including. Some other ways the maps do not meet requirements of Section 4.81 are:

1.	They are not prepared on USGS topographic quandrangle maps or a similar maps of a state agency. USGS topographic quadrangle maps are readily available online.
2.	When multiple maps are provided, Section 4.81 requires that an index sheet is included. The application is lacking an index sheet.
3.	Many principal project features are not identified on the maps, including, but not limited to the proposed upper reservoirs, dams and water conveyance facilities.
4.	Four of the maps lack sufficient detail, have no notation, legend or other means to clearly identify what is being represented.

Transmission Lines

The application is inconsistent in its reporting of the high voltage transmission lines running from the power plant to the Central Hudson substation.

The written description in the application states that 230 kv transmission lines are proposed. The maps show 500 kv transmission lines. The difference is significant in many aspects including, that 500 kv transmission lines require higher towers, additional clearance, wider right-of-way, further affecting the use of private properties and residences through which the route of the transmission lines pass.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Neil Harley under P-15056.

It has come to my attention that Premium Energy Holdings LLC has applied for permission to construct a dam, reservoir, pipeline, powerhouse and high voltage electrical lines in my beloved and pristine Stoney Clove Valley. The Lanesville home that I have lived in for the past 50 years is right smack in the middle of this proposed site. Has this so called company heard that the area we live in has been designated as a forever wild Forest Preserve?

Would you allow them to destroy an ancient ecosystem, where native brook trout, whitetail deer, black bear, bobcat, fox, eagles, hawks and yes even blue heron&#39;s call home. As a senior citizen who loves the outdoors do I want access to my favorite, local, hiking trails eliminated. To this I answer with a resounding NO!

Our beloved scenic byway Route 214 is our only access to our recreational ski mountains, hiking trails and favorite fishing spots along the pure waters of the Stoney Clove Creek. You would allow them to destroy all of this in the name of supposedly renewable energy. That makes no sense to me at all. Let&#39;s ruin something thats good and beautiful to satisfy some ludicrous political agenda.

Please be warned that we fought and won to outlaw fracking in our Forest Preserve  and we will fight and win in shutting down this ridiculous idea also. I am willing to spend whatever it takes to pay for lawyers and support grass roots community activists, who will fight with us, to end this abuse of power.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

My daughter and son-in-law are farmers at 1375 Hurley Mountain Road in Hurley, NY and my husband and I jointly own the property that includes land that would be negatively impacted by the Premium Energy Holdings proposal.

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Shelley Levine</pre><hr><b>Comments of Sharon Calcote under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Sharon Calcote, Austin, TX.

Re: Project P-15056 Ashokan Pumped Storage 


Dear Secretary Bose:

My family owns a home at 791 Vly Road, in the affected Town of Olive.  I have a number of questions and concerns regarding this project: 

1.	Proposal Depends on Future Event – Change to the State Constitution 
Each proposed site in the application would use (or acquire) land that is designated by New Your State as a forest preserve.  Forest preserves are protected under Article XIV in the New York State Constitution.  It says, “The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private…”  Consequently, wouldn’t a change to the State Constitution be required to fully enable the proposed project?  FERC 18CFR 4.32(J) states, “An application the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.”  Therefore, shouldn’t the application be denied?

2.	Proposal Depends on Future Event – New Transmission Line 
The proposals states, “In order to store energy or deliver power to the regional electrical utility network, construction of a new 230 AC transmission line will be necessary to transmit power from the Ashokan Pumped Storage Switchyard to the existing Hurley Avenue Substation.”  FERC 18CFR 4.32(J) states, “An application the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.”  Therefore, shouldn’t the application be denied?

3.	Project Is Not Closed-Loop, as Claimed by the Applicant
The proposal claims the project is closed-loop.  It is not.  The Esopus Creek continually runs into the Ashokan Reservoir.  The Esopus Creek also runs out of the Ashokan Reservoir.  In addition, there is a parallel and continual outflow the Catskill Aqueduct, which supplies drinking water to New York City.  At the very least, shouldn’t the application be required to resubmit, defining the system as open-loop?  Also, as I understand it, open-loop pumped storage systems present a higher risk of water contamination than closed-loop systems, due to increased turbidity.  The scientific research on the water quality associated with open-loop systems appears to be sparse.  Given this proposed system would be tied to a critical unfiltered water supply for a major metropolitan area, aren’t the risks too great to grant approval even for a preliminary study at this time?  

4.	Does the Region Need for More Power Generation?
The proposal is based on the assumption that more power generation is required for this region in the foreseeable future.  Are there credible projections that suggest that is the case?  If not, shouldn’t the application be denied?

Based at least on 1-3 above, I respectfully request the FERC deny application approval at this stage. 

Sincerely,

David Burkhart, PMP

Pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our transition to renewable energy but the pristine forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed. The NYS Constitution clearly guarantees that these lands “shall be … forever wild.&#34; Such lands will not be leased, sold or exchanged, nor held by any corporation, public or private. The Preserve&#39;s thousands of acres of continuous wildlife habitat cannot be traded away, setting a dire precedent for protected lands across the country.

Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on stream ecologies and on aquatic and land habitats. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries. The Project would negatively affect Esopus Creek, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply. It would be short-sighted to allow a project to proceed that would threaten the Ashokan Reservoir, the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, representing billions of dollars in public investment. If the Reservoir succumbs and fails to meet water quality standards, the State will bear massive costs for remediation.

Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, requiring the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain. Given the real estate &#34;boom&#34; in the Valley, displaced residents would have a hard time securing new housing. Beyond the problem of displacement, the project would hurt the vital Catskills tourism economy by limiting access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts in the region, and dampen tourism across the region, hurting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Finally, the Project does not represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy seeks. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.

I must protest this project.  I used to be an Environmental Chemist for Westchester County and am now a staunch environmentalist.  We found serious problems with sediment in reservoir water, and that is without even involving a major construction project as this one.  I cannot believe this is environmentally sound, and the consequences are difficult to predict.  New York State has other sources of energy much less intrusive than this project.

Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Washington, D.C. 20426.
Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

Premium Energy’s above-captioned proposal to FERC was developed without any familiarity with the terrain or the communities where the pumped storage facility would ostensibly be located. Nor did they contact any of the affected municipalities, including Ulster County, before submitting their proposal. It is hard to believe that this is a serious proposal at all, given Premium Energy’s failure to consider the most basic problems with its scheme.

Premium Energy’s proposal is internally contradictory, stating on page 6 of its letter (dated January 9, 2021) in response to the FERC’s notification of deficiencies that it “would use the existing Ashokan reservoir as a lower pool and proposes a new upper reservoir in the Catskill Mountains to serve as upper pool. The filling of these reservoirs would be done through the Esopus Creek and the existing Ashokan Reservoir,” and on page 11 of the same letter that the proposed project would operate in a “closed loop. Aside from evaporation and percolation losses, the project’s water would stay within the system. Therefore, the existing Ashokan Reservoir’s remaining water storage would not be used for project operation.”

The Woodland Valley and Wittenberg Reservoir sites proposed for the creation of a second reservoir are located within the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area, a constitutionally protected wilderness in New York State. At 47,500 acres, it is the largest tract of state-owned Forest Preserve in New York&#39;s Catskill Park, and the largest area under any kind of wilderness area protection between the Adirondacks and the southern Appalachians.

The Catskill Park is protected from development. “The state constitution requires that any property owned or acquired by the state in those parks ‘be forever kept as wild forest lands’ and prohibits it from selling or transferring them in any way (save amending that section of the constitution to allow specific transactions)” (Wikipedia).

The area is home to rare and threatened species, including the nodding pogonia and other endangered animal and plant species. According to the Slide Mountain Wilderness Unit Management Plan: &#34;Rare Plants: A large colony of the orchid nodding pogonia (triphora trianthophora) occurs at a low elevation in one ravine in the unit. Rare in the northeast, this orchid is found in only three other locations in New York State&#34; (p. 6).

Thanks to New York States unique management approach, the Catskill Park is not only a protected wilderness, but one that serves the recreational and educational needs of hundreds of thousands of people every year. 

Should the Woodland Valley location be selected, the new reservoir would not only inundate many properties but would block access to additional homes at the head of the Valley, as well as to the State-managed Woodland Valley Campground, which offers 70 tent and trailer sites, along with easy access to fishing and hiking. The Woodland Valley campground serves as the trail-head for both the Slide-Wittenberg Trail (the Burroughs Range) and the Woodland Valley-Denning Trail, which provides access to the Giant Ledge-Panther Mountain Trail.

Woodland Valley Stream is a famous trout fishing stream, containing brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout, as well as cutlips minnow, blacknose dace, longnose dace, sculpin, and white sucker. 

All of the proposed sites have important historical resonance. At the heart of the terrain is the Burroughs Range, named for naturalist John Burroughs, an eloquent advocate for the region. His 1910 essay In the Heart of the Southern Catskills describes his first experiences exploring the Wittenberg-Slide-Cornell area. Burroughs, whom The Atlantic once called “the single most popular nature writer in America for many decades (The Atlantic, May 2006 issue), helped found the environmental movement in the US. Destroying the historic heart of the place he so loved would send a terrible message about this country’s environmental values and appreciation of wild places. 

There is another history in the region that also militates against the proposed project. Between 1907 and 1915, 16 communities were inundated and approximately two thousand residents were forcibly relocated, while roads, homes, shops, farms, churches, and mills were taken by eminent domain and either moved, abandoned, or torn down, with laughably small recompense. The vent has recently been memorialized in a beautifully illustrated series of four articles, beginning in November 2020, in Places journal. As stated there, “For upstaters, the reservoirs that provide water to New York City represent at best an imposition and at worst an imperial pillage of the landscape” (https://placesjournal.org/article/reservoir-an-account-of-human-costs/).

Last but not least, the movement of millions of gallons through the Ashokan reservoir and Esopus Creek would further threaten the water quality of New York City, which is the largest city in the US to offer unfiltered drinking water to its residents. The Ashokan provides 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. The city is already struggling to maintain the quality of its drinking water, as demonstrated by its frequent releases of muddy water into the Esopus, turning it cocoa brown and generating resistance and heated negotiations between New York City and the local municipalities whose own natural resources and attractiveness for tourism are directly impacted. 

My family has been resident in the Woodland Valley since the 1800s. I strongly urge the FERC to decline the request by Premium Energy Holdings for a preliminary permit to further develop its hare-brained scheme scheme (with apologies to hares) to build Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

To whom it may concern,
I am a resident of Woodland Valley in Phoenicia New York, and have recently become aware of the outlandish proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings. While I am a firm believer in- and proponent of- clean energy alternatives, I am vehemently opposed to the aformentioned project on more levels than I can even begin to express in the space allotted.

After studying the proposal in great detail, it seems obvious that its completion would have a profound negative effect on the precious Catskill preserve- a unique and sacred area that is singular and cherished by so many. Its effect on the Eusopus and its tributaries alone make it unthinkable to anyone who delights in the pristine streams that make up this area. 
It would negatively impact the New York City water supply and undoubtedly have a delirious effect on local tourism-which is vital to the livelihoods of so many residents.
I could go on and on with technical objections to the project—but why point out what you clearly already know?

On a personal level- I am neighbors with a family living in a home that was moved from the Ashokan reservoir nearly a century ago. They have personally recounted to me on several occasions the emotional impact and trauma that their family, and so many others, experienced when their homes were destroyed and their lives uprooted. It’s unthinkable to imagine something like that happening in our backyard today.

I know I speak for nearly all of my neighbors- many of whom may have no doubt already voiced their objections-when I say that this is a highly unpopular proposal of which virtually no resident is in favor.

We sincerely hope you will put an end to it in its early stages.

Thank you

I vehemently oppose this project for the following reasons: 

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.

The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 

This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.

It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.

The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.

The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Howard J Fisher under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Howard J Fisher, Santa Fe, NM.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I oppose the misguided proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant—the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056—in New York’s Catskill Mountains.  this project would ruin the environment and disrupt many local communities.  It also poses a serious risk to the safety and purity of New York City’s drinking water.   I urge you to deny their request for a preliminary permit.
Although I live in New Mexico, I and millions of other tourists around the country travel to the Catskills area to enjoy the very beauty and calm that this ill-conceived project threatens.  Please do not allow it to proceed.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose--

I write to ask that FERC turn down Premium Energy Holdings&#39; request for a preliminary permit for the misguided Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056).
 
The authors of the proposal either don&#39;t know or are misrepresenting the location of the proposed project. Well-placed hydroelectric power facilities are clearly key to sustainable energy maintenance, but Premium Energy Holdings-- a California concern--falsely characterizes the target are as being &#34;near&#34; the vital Catskill Forest Preserve. The locations they put forward, and the Ashokan Reservoir--we live a few minutes from Olive, one of the three sites under consideration for the additional reservoir--are indeed at the CFP&#39;s very center and are thus protected from commercial exploitation and acquisition by eminent domain by the New York State Constitution. As I understand it the Department of Energy&#39;s own policies counsel avoiding development in protected ecosystems such as this remarkably well-preserved area.

In addition, I am deeply concerned about the impact on the sediment levels in the local watershed, including the Esopus Creek, famed for trout fishing and for tubing. We have cousins from Syracuse who visit the area for the trout season and friends, plus relatives from other states and even other countries who come up here to access Hunter Mountain for skiing. They bring revenue to the local motels and beds-and-breakfasts, gas stations, restaurants and sporting goods stores. So not only the natural beauty of this area is under jeopardy but--multiplying our acquaintances and relatives&#39; examples by the tens of thousands--the vibrancy and viability of its tourism industry. 

Add on the possible threat--since the proposal as I understand it does not in fact constitute an ecologically sound closed-loop system as it claims to--to the water supply of the 9 million residents of New York City, where we also own property. As it is, the reservoir outflow&#39;s turbidity has been an issue of much recent concern by local residents and New York City officials as well. Why on earth should a potential additional threat to that drinking water be fast tracked? Premium Energy’s flawed and clearly mendacious proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 must be turned down!

Many thanks for your attention in this matter.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would:
1. devastate the environment and ecosystem, 
2. disrupt and displace local communities and local businesses, 
3. put the purity of NYC’s drinking water at risk.

Pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in transition to renewable energy, but the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago.

Re:    FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing as a concerned resident of Mount Tremper, NY regarding a proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

My wife and I recently sold our primary residence in NJ and decided to move full time to what was our weekend home in Mount Tremper.  Our decision to make Ulster County and the Town of Shandaken in particular, our permanent home is primarily the community.  We thought this tight knit, hardworking community who care about each other were as protected from development as the pristine forests where we all reside.

To think that whole communities will be displaced by permanent, engineered flooding if this project were to be approved is hard to comprehend.   Particularly during a time when many residents are struggling to stay healthy and literally keep their head above water financially.  Government dictated compensation for displaced homeowners will not allow these friends and neighbors to remain in the area.

Coming from a State with a history of awful environmental and eminent domain abuses (i.e. Long Branch, NJ), I thought living within the protected watershed for NYC’s 8 Million &#43; residents would ensure that the local community and its environs would stay intact and safe from developmental abuses of any kind.

I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy Holdings request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, primarily because it would displace long-time residents in a very tight housing market, have a devastating impact on local wildlife, and reduce much needed tourism to the area.

Visitors and residents hold dear the undisturbed natural beauty of Catskill Park.  Tourists from NYC and NJ seek to escape the disruptive power generation and transmission projects that have no place in a “forever wild” park.

Renewable, green-energy sources should not come with irreversible community and environmental costs. 

Please use your power to stop this misguided project and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

As a resident of New York City, which is using the Ashokan Reservoir as a source of water, I am concerned about using that water for other purposes. In particular, I am concerned about the possibility of introducing invasive species that can affect the water or the distribution system. By effectively extending the reservoir, especially into an area not controlled by the NYC DEP, additional opportunities for invasive species to enter the water are created.

I think this proposed hydro electric plant is crazy.  It&#39;s right in the middle of a watershed for New York City.  There is no way to guarantee the safety of the water with a project like this in the drainage basin.  Plus, this project is in the Catskill Park, which is comprised of a lot of forever wild land.  FOREVER WILD.  That still means something. Doesn&#39;t it?  Our area is seeing a boom in eco tourism. This is hiking, camping, biking, fishing, and many other outdoor activities that are dependent on the wilderness.  Remaining wild.  Please deny this application. It does&#39;t suit the intended use of this area.  Thank you.

I am frankly appalled at this proposal. The plan is completely reckless and is totally without regard to the local environmental system. The word preposterous comes to mind.

Here are just a few things that would change for the worse:
1: Hiking up to Friday and Balsam Cap Mountains would be eliminated thanks to the flooding of Moonhaw Road. 
2: The area is a spawning area of trout fisheries. Something Shandaken is well-known for.
3: The construction will disturb one of the most pristine views in the Catskills with added power lines, not to mention that the construction process itself will be invasive, loud, dirty, and inconvenient to residents in the area.
4: The proposed sites in the the area are Status 1 Land. The DOE has said that Status 1 and 2 land must be avoided for development. The Catskill Park can not be developed on without an amendment to the state constitution which protects the park specifically.
5: This project is likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, and it will cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lisa St. John under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

Under no circumstances should the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceed with its application for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. The impact of this project on the community and environment would be unethical and illegal.

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area. According to the National Audubon Society, the Ashokan site has supported a nesting pair of Bald Eagles for the past ten years and hosts up to six Bald Eagles during the winter. Our national bird, the symbol of justice and democracy, would be displaced. Hopefully, you can see the irony in this situation.

I am certain that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can find a more suitable place for a pumped storage project, one that would not disrupting the Ashokan Reservoir community to a devastating degree.

Thank You,

Dear Secretary Bose, 

I write in opposition to the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal filed by Premium Energy Holdings LLC. This is a highly flawed proposal. The impact of this power plant, if implemented, will devastate the environment, wildlife, and recreation in the area, as well as, the local community and economy.

Most importantly, it threatens the water quality and supply for New York City.

It is difficult to understand the benefits of this plan in relation to all the harm it will cause. The plan does not address an identified energy deficit. While hydroelectric power can be a green energy solution in some scenarios, this is not one.

Please include these considerations in the evaluation of this proposal.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Laura Draper

How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Building a new hydro-electric dam in the Catskills, in a protected wild area is not congruent with the law nor the needs of the future. Although we need clean energy to combat climate change, destroying protected wild areas and reservoirs that supply clean water to NYC is not the way to do it. This ill thought out and destructive project should be immediately dismissed.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Terri Basilone under P-15056.

I am vehemently opposed to Premium Energy Holdings proposal of a pumped storage system at the Ashokan resevoir p-15056. 

I moved to West Shokan 20 years ago because the pristine 700,000 acres in the Catskill Preserve is to be left wild and untouched. The protected Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program” created in 1885. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

As well as the transmission lines going right through our property,I have a business that would also directly be affected. Tourism is a big part of our economy.
Premium Energys proposal would be a complete devastation to our eco system, community,wildlife,streams and the millions that come to hike,bike,eat,visit our shops and take in the natural beauty every year.

None of the 3 locations proposed are right for this enormous, intrusive project.


Premium Energy is saying this is to be &#34;closed-looped&#34;. It is not ,it is an &#34;add on&#34; and would likely increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed.The redirection of water would likely impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.

NYC has been famous for their drinking water because it comes from here! 
One little likely mishap could threaten the drinking water of nine million plus.

I urge FERC not to grant this preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

I am writing in response to the proposed Ashokan pump storage project to be located in the Town of Olive, docket number P-15056-000.  The preliminary proposal was poorly thought out. It should be denied because of lack of facts and a general lack of merit. It should be rejected for legal reasons, for the impact on citizens’ use of the land for recreation, for the impact on a unique and important non fragmented ecosystem, for disruption of stream ecology, and for the impact on a tourist industry.
The legal ramifications of allowing a private company to ignore the New York State Constitution sets the stage for a destructive precedent. I, and my family, should be protected by our NY Constitution. I chose to live in the Town of Olive and raise my family there because of the protected land. My family makes use of the hiking trails in the Forever Wild Land and State Forest land. We also recreate on the Esopus. As bird watchers we spend considerable amount of time exploring the many species of birds in the protected Catskill Park. The Park is protected as a unique set of wilderness mountains in NY State. As a protected ecosystem, the Park harbors high elevation spruce/fir woodlands and the birds and animal species that inhabit these. The Park also protects the mixed hardwood forests. Important to each of these areas, the fact that they are protected in our Constitution makes the Catskill Park one of the only areas in the state where woodlands are not fragmented. Research has shown that fragmentation creates a vulnerability that disrupts the animal inhabitants. Research has used the wood thrush as an example. When wood thrush territory is fragmented the birds have a significantly poorer rate of reproduction. Bicknell’s Thrush inhabit the currently non fragmented high elevation areas in the Catskill Park. The negative impact on the ecosystems and its inhabitants will impact the local ecology of the Park, and my, and my family’s use of the area. Our mountain hiking will be impacted, our snowshoeing in the mountains will be impacted. Our mountain biking and fishing will be impacted, all in negative ways.
Turbidity naturally occurs in the Esopus with heavy storms or seasonal runoff. This impacts trout particularly. This project will significantly increase the levels and frequency of turbidity in the Esopus. As a result of stream degradation, the stream ecology and trout populations will be negatively impacted. Bald Eagles hunt the Esopus and need clear water for spotting fish. Thus the wildlife, and my family&#39;s use of the Esopus, for recreating, and particularly for fly fishing, will be negatively impacted. I chose to live here in the Town of Olive because these wild areas are protected by the State Constitution. Protected land should remain protected, that is the definition of the word. Projects such as this pump storage one need to be located on land that is not so special and important for ecosystems, recreating, and functioning for the local tourist industry. The Catskill Park is protected legally for good reasons. Energy projects need to be located on non protected land. That way green energy could be made use of, but not at the expense of unique lands in our state. I represent but one family, however my family is typical of countless people and families that recreate in the Catskill Park.
There is a successful tourist industry in this area. Countless people from New York City and New Jersey travel here to look at the fall colors, to ski at the ski centers, to hike and bird watch, and to enjoy the lovely vistas and clean air. Disruptions of roads, the presence of new high tension wires, the creation of a new reservoir which will actually look more like a huge bathtub that is filled and emptied  on a daily basis, and the years of infrastructure creation, could have a negative impact on the tourist industry. The need for energy and energy storage, is a fact, but there must be a consideration of obtaining this energy or energy storage in an area that is not so unique that it is legally protected by a State Constitution.

I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

To Whom This May Concern:

I am yet again disturbed by the rush by inconsiderate corporations and entities to use and forever damage public lands for private gain.

The reasons why it matters to me is that I live here. This land is a buffer between the over development of cities and the expansion of human habitation. It is no joke. We need the land to be as it was designated to be in 1885. Even back then they appreciated the value of nature. this is my land. Not theirs. You need to protect the rights of citizens.

It would be easy for the developers to ignore the many scientific and moral reasons and go with something like, &#34;Get over it.&#34; That&#39;s what happens time and time again with the powerful components of our society. They ignore the facts and use propaganda and power to take from us what is ours.

Here are some actual, intelligent, rational, scientific, moral, and humane reasons it is a bad proposition to take over public lands that are earmarked for recreation and heritage purposes:

1. Legal: It is currently illegal to develop this land as it was designated in 1885 as a Forest Preserve, which is Status 1 land. The Department of Energy designates Status 1 and 2 lands as being avoided for development. Given that fact, why was this project allowed to even start? That should be investigated. Someone dropped the ball at square one. Start a project where is legal in the first place instead of trying to bully taxpayers and trying to mislead everyone. It is not ok. We should not have to spend time like this trying to fight another battle with greedy people who move the lines of legality to suit themselves only.

2. Scientific: Stream ecology will be impacted, animal habitats will not withstand the fluctuations of water flow, trout breeding grounds will be impacted if not lost. They will be destroying habitats of millions of animals. How is that unimportant? 

3. Moral: the project is a lie, this is an add-on project, not a closed loop one. It would have significantly higher impacts than they say, and will cost significantly more. This project is manipulating information and should be stopped altogether and should be penalized for false representation and wasting valuable time of our officials and scientists. It is a major impact and is dressed as a minor one. This is not land for commercial use.

4. Humane: Animals will lose their habitats. Land will be destroyed, Our tourism in the Catskill will be impacted. 

I hate to bore people with reasons, when they are deluded with greed for money, and are propelled by that. Whereas the community at large are not aware or impelled as much and will sorely regret not having made their voices heard because they are not being driven by those same forces of monetary gain.

RE: P-15056 Premium Energy Holdings LLC Preliminary Permit application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Director Yearick,

We, the below signed members of the Ulster County Legislature, hereby unanimously submit the following to be considered public comment in the matter of Premium Energy Holdings LLC Preliminary Permit application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project: P-15056.

Our commitment to sustainable, renewable power enterprises notwithstanding, projects of this nature should not, and cannot be initiated under a shroud of secrecy. We are appalled at the lack of transparency demonstrated thus far for a proposal of this size and scope located in one of New York State’s most protected regions. For the past month we have received repeated protests from local and state officials and community stakeholders who were caught off guard and by surprise. Regrettably we must count ourselves among those who were blindsided by the existence of a permit application for a Pumped Storage Hydroelectric power system under and upstream of the Ashokan Reservoir. 

It is incumbent upon us as Ulster County elected representatives to make sure that there is no harm caused to our communities. Even under the best of circumstances this proposal will cause serious upheaval to residents and visitors alike. It’s sad that Olive and the mountain communities have, for the last 100 years, worked with New York City to supply and protect one of the best water resources in the world. Now Ulster County communities, already stripped of 118,000 acres owned by NY City and another 250,000 owned by NYS, are once again being asked to cede more property both public and private. 

The current proposal appears to raise more questions than answers. Each of the proposed sites for the new upper reservoir present numerous concerns and questions. A quick and cursory reading of the proposal point to the blocking of spawning areas of a number of trout fisheries, potential, if not assured flooding of residential communities and access points to popular hiking trails, and serious encroachments on constitutionally designated forever wild lands.  Additionally, there are unknown effects on underground aquifers and private wells upon which hundreds Ulster County’s rural residents depend, and question as to how will this plant effect the turbidity in the Ashokan and by consequence the Lower Esopus; an issue this body has been struggling to have adequately addressed for more than a decade? 

We understand that this proposal is in its infancy and at a very preliminary point in the environmental review process. With that said, there has been an inexcusable lack of public notice and transparency. A project of this size and scope demands and deserves review and comment by elected representatives, residents, and community stakeholders. We take seriously our responsibility as the stewards of Ulster County’s unique and amazing natural resources and will continue to advocate for their preservation and protection. 

We appreciate your time. 
 

Sincerely,

It would be a travesty to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land. In a time when natural landscapes like the Catskill Mountains are increasingly a luxury commodity, it would set an awful precedent for protected lands across the country—not to mention in New York State, a place that prides itself on its natural environs.

I am writing in response to the proposed Ashokan pump storage project to be located in the Town of Olive, docket number P-15056-000.  The preliminary proposal fails any basic “due diligence” test.  It should be denied because it ignores many basic critical facts pertaining to the proposed site. The impacts on a protected wilderness, on important recreational resources, on an important tourism industry, and perhaps most importantly on the availability of drinking water for 9 million people have all been ignored in this badly done proposal.
The Catskill Park is home to protected ecosystems including plants and endangered animals.  This protection is established in the New York State Constitution, and overriding that protection would set a dangerous precedent. 
Turbidity naturally occurs in the Esopus with heavy storms or seasonal runoff.  This ill-conceived project would make such turbidity a daily event.  The proposed lower reservoir is the Ashoken Reservoir, a major source of water for the 9 million people in New York City.  Currently this is one of the few major water systems which can operate without filtration requirements, but this project would destroy that.  A private for-profit company has NO right to inflict such a staggering costs on a unit of government while they pocket some profits. 
The tourist industry is critically important to this area. Many people from New York City and throughout the Northeast travel here to hike and bird watch, to see the fall foliage, and to ski at the ski centers.  Disruptions of roads, the presence of new high tension wires, the creation of a new reservoir which will actually look more like a huge bathtub that is filled and emptied  on a daily basis, and the years of infrastructure creation, could have a negative impact on the tourist industry. The need for energy and energy storage, is a fact, but there must be a consideration of obtaining this energy or energy storage in an area that is not so unique that it is legally protected by a State Constitution.

I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

To whom it may concern,

I stand with Senator Michelle Hinchey and the Catskill Center in opposition to Premium Energy Holdings proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As a citizen living in close proximity to the reservoir I am against the construction and infrastructure required in the proposal. I greatly enjoy the scenic landscape and the life that abounds in and around the Ashokan and do not want increased traffic, noise, pollution and potential problems that come with a large scale project like this. As a fisherman I oppose the project for the impact it will have on the wildlife and water quality for years to come. Please reject this proposal.

Re: docket number P-15056-000, the proposed Premium Energy hydroelectric plant on the upper end of the Ashokan Reservoir.

This project would be detrimental in so many ways that I can hardly believe it is even being considered. For starters, the Askokan is an open system, meaning that the turbidity created by the daily release of water would impact both New York City’s drinking water quality, but also be the death knell for aquatic life in the already heavily-impacted Esopus Creek. 

Construction of a system of this scale would damage pristine and near-pristine natural areas in a place famous for its beauty and its healthy ecosystem. The creation of water basins would disrupt fish spawning, and bird and animal habitat. Human beings live in these areas, too. It is unthinkable that homes in families for generations could be razed, or their value reduced, by the intrusion of this massive project.

This proposal will benefit no one in the immediate area. The benefit to the power reserve in general is far outweighed by the negative impact it would have on local communities and natural habitats.

The “Premium Energy” plan for a new hydro electric system is a terrible idea. 

Frankly, I don’t see anything beneficial in this plan, but I do see damage to an area known for its beauty, its sports, and its wildlife.

I understand this has been tried before in “closed systems” (not affecting places where people actually live). But they’re talking about disturbing some of the most beautiful countryside in the Sate. Taking away land, places where people live, fish, hike -- affecting tourism, and the various reasons why people live in and visit the area. Furthermore, the quality of the water reaching New York City is bound to be adversely affected as more water churns up the Ashokan Reservoir.

With no guarantees that residents would see any real financial benefit. To me, a New York City resident who bought property in the area 30 years ago and pays taxes, I see a lose/lose situation.

A hundred years ago, the Ashokan Reservoir uprooted thousands of people, and the water which flowed to New York City came at the cost of towns, communities, and local history. That’s done, and the result is a delicate balance of beauty and infrastructure. Please, please, please, don’t mess with what we already have.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Trevor Hotz under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

Hello,
I am a homeowner and business owner in Boiceville, NY for the last 7 years. It will be a detriment to our community to have this Pumped Storage Project approved. Not only will it reduce home values in our area but will have an enormous impact on those who live around the area where the project will be located.
I am a realtor with an office in Boiceville, NY. The area in which I conduct most of my business is Olive, West Shokan, Woodland Valley, West Hurley, and Mt Tremper. It will seriously affect home prices! It will sway people from buying in the area where the proposed powerhouse will be. It will be a blight on the land where the proposed reservoir will be. The flora and fauna will suffer and there will be a terrible consequence to pay for lost habitat.
Let me make myself perfectly clear, I am deeply opposed to this project and will do all that I must to prevent this from happening.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I am a long-time resident in Ulster County and frequent visitor to the Ashokan Reservoir. I’m aware of the history of the construction of this reservoir; that many communites were uprooted to build it. It obviously serves a crucial function, as New York City’s primary water source, but I am very opposed to another such project. In addition to displacing communities, it would negatively impact wildlife and the purity of our watershed.

The proposed hydroelectric plant is a threat the the Ashokan Reservoir. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the Catskills system for the NYC area, supplies up to 40% of the city’s daily needs. The reservoirs was carefully constructed, considering the local ecosystems and habitats to ensure safe drinking water. The hydroelectric plant could greatly damage this system in various ways. The powerlines will fragment habitats and ecosystems and disrupt the environment. It also would be disastrous for the tourist economy that exists as one of the few sources of support for the region.

I am writing in response to the outrageous proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a plant in the Catskills. I strongly urge FERC to deny their request for permit for a number of reasons. If this project is allowed to proceed, it would be devastating to the environment, displace people from their homes, disrupt the local community, and risk the purity of NYC water. While these types of plants are necessary to move us towards more renewable energy, the Catskills are not the place to do this. This land is meant to remain protected. The pumped storage will wreak havoc on the local ecology. In addition to environmental impacts, the community would be ripped apart, displacing people from their homes in order to seize the land. There is already a housing shortage as more and more people are leaving city areas to move to upstate communities. These people will have no where to go if displaced from their homes. The local economy thrives partly on tourism due to the beautiful hiking and outdoor recreational opportunities it has to offer. This would also be severely damaged if this project proceeds, which would in turn have a large impact on local businesses. The impacts of this trickle down to all aspects of life in this community. Please consider this and put an end to this project. Save our community!</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lucy Childs under P-15056.

I am writing to FERC to encourage the rejection of the Application for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project as applied for by Premium of California.  

In reading the Premium of California application in section 1. General Construction, the application states  “The Project proposes to use the existing Ashokan Reservoir as a lower pool” and immediately contradicts that statement in the following paragraph “ The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would operate in a closed loop. “
The application continues to comment on the value of a closed loop plan proposal, but in review of the plans laid out in the application and with a local understanding of the Ashokan Reservoir upper basin, the plans do not meet the most basic commitment of closed loop.  The non closed loop plan as documented references the impact on the reservoir basin water with respect to water level changes but fails to consider or comment on the potential impact of increased turbidity in the existing reservoir system providing approximately 40% of the drinking water for New York City. 

In further reading of the application, it is clear that this proposal is so poorly prepared that a lay person as myself would hope that this proposal is rejected outright.  As a strong proponent of renewable energy and hence an understanding that pumped storage hydro will be an important part of our future renewable power needs, I read this proposal with interest.  For that reason, I also want to comment that all energy creation and storage is not equal.  If preserving a sustainable environment and meeting our human resources needs is our goal then a poor choice of location or strategy of locations for pumped storage must also be considered.  I advocate that the locations chosen in this proposal should also be rejected.  I will comment on those environmental reasons for rejection below. I advocate for a future looking strategy, understanding that it may well challenge our engineers and technologists, but a strategy that selects locations that avoid further impacting environmentally pristine wildlife habitat, which require generations to restore, should be the goal.  Preservation of existing natural environments is critical to any sustainability model.  Given our history of damaging environmentally sound sites to meet our resource needs in the past, we now have the opportunity to challenge our brightest minds to choose locations wisely.  With improved selection of locations, there is also an opportunity to restore native environments to locations that are currently being damaged or were previously damaged to meet  human needs.  I challenge our engineering communities to identify such locations, for example locations that are being or have been mined or quarried and have not yet recovered environmentally.

Notable aspects of the land being considered in this proposal:

The Department of Energy Hydropower Vision report documents their framework with “Sustainability” as one of three pillars indicating  “Ensure that hydropower’s contributions toward meeting the nation’s energy needs are consistent with the objectives of environmental stewardship and water use management.”  Further 3.3.4 Hydropower Environmental Considerations of the Hydropower Vision report highlights among others: critical habitat, species of concern, and protected lands.


Critical Habitat and Species of Concern:
The land identified in the proposal is home to several species that have received notable statements for protection:  the protected Three Birst Orchid registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for Northern America, identified Audubon Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area, northern long-eared bat summer foraging habitat and timber rattlesnake habitat identified NY-Threatened, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush habitat identified NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk and sharp-shinned hawk and eastern hognose snake habitat identified NY-Special Concern.

The streams and creeks impacted are both trout waters and trout spawning habitat.

Protected Land: 
The proposal’s impact to the Catskill Forest Preserve has had special protection under the NY State Constitution since 1885. Article XIV of the NYS Constitution specifically states that these forested lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild...&#34;. And that they &#34;shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; 

State Forest Preserves which includes the Catskill Park Preserve, are classified under USGS Gap Analysis Program. The Department of Energy Hydropower Vision report states “Areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the U.S. Geological Survey’s Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

Lastly, a few generations back the communities and the natural environment contained within this proposal were severely impacted to meet the drinking water needs of nearby New York City.  There is an ongoing relationship that requires significant management to meet the needs of our NYC neighbors and the livelihoods of our remaining communities.  I will let NYC comment on the impact of this proposal to the NYC drinking water, but I will note that our communities&#39; livelihoods are significantly built on a tourism economy from our amazing protected natural resources.

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

	1) Article XIV of the NYS Constitution guarantees that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Changes. if any, to the status of this land would require a constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions of the state legistalure and then subnmitted to a public vote by referendum.

	2)  Contrary to the description in Premium&#39;s application, this is not a closed-loop project, which is the kind of project the Department of Energy wants to see due to its lower environmental impacts.  It is an add-on project, using an existing body of water as the lower reservoir.  Add-on projects have significantly higher risks.  The Esopus Creek and other streams flow into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir (which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people). The  proposed project would therefore directly interact with an unfiltered public water source. Since the Catskills are within a State Forest Preserve, they are designated Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. The Department of Energy&#39;s own materials on hydropower state a clear preference for closed-loop and not add-on projects and indicate that development of Status 1 or 2 lands should be avoided.  

	3)  Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters.  Water level fluctuations would also increase turbidity within the Reservoir itself.  NYC is not presently required to filter the Ashokan water pursuant to long-standing EPA consent to the New York City Filtration Avoidance Program (FAD).  EPA&#39;s consent was just renewed in December 2017.  If Premium&#39;s application were to be granted, this would potentially create a conflict between the positions taken by two federal agencies.

	4)  Ulster County should not have been the only county notified of Premium&#39;s proposal.  The proposed Stony Clove Reservoir actually falls within the Town of Hunter in Greene County.  Upon information and belief, Greene County was never notifed of Premium&#39;s application, rendering it defective on its face.

	5) In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, requiring the seizing of private property by eminent domain in any of the locations proposed by Premium. Displaced residents would have difficulty securing new, affordable housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County.  There would also be a negative effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Dear Kimberly D. Bose and the Federal Energy Commission,

I am a resident of Chichester, Ulster County, New York just south of a potential dam in a project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings, under review by FERC (docket #P-15056-000). I must state my opposition of the granting of even a preliminary permit. There are many problems with the proposed hydropower plant currently under consideration. It appears there was little consideration of a multitude of factors that make the Catskills Park an inappropriate place for this project. Below I list a few of them.

First of all, the Catskills are a State preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The Catskills Forest Preserve, in the midst of which this project would be situated (the project states falsely that it lies outside of the protected Catskills Preserve, but it does not), is considered status 1 land under the USGS gap analysis program according to the US Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Report. Stoney Clove Stream (and the entire Ashokan Reservoir connective tissue of streams and rivers)is a very important and living resource for wildlife that depend on it for survival, the whole reason the preserve exists to begin with.

This proposal is both deficient and misleading. The system is not a closed loop as stated. As proposed it is actually an open loop system. The damage from this kind of system on the environment would be quite significant and destructive to the surrounding area for wildlife as well as for the local economy. Giving an example of its impact on humans and nature together, it contributes to the life of aquatic organisms that feed trout, who then in turn supply the surrounding area with fisherman who contribute to the economies of many towns and hamlets involved in the ecosystem. It is a source of food and water for the deer, bear, coyote, other smaller animals and birds of the area as well.

There would creation of increased water turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir, which is dealing with these problems already and would negatively impact the water system that serves as NYC’s drinking water. 

I support the movement away from fossil fuel reliance towards renewable energy, and understand that hydropower is a strong component of this progress. The Catskill region however is the wrong placement for such projects. Please do not allow this project to continue.

Sincerely,
Annarose Lipkin</pre><hr><b>Comments of Sandra Friedel under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Sandra Friedel, West Shokan, NY.
I am 81 years old , lived in Olive since 1981 and just can’t fathom leaving my home which is in the center of this proposal. It would put my home 50 feet under water. The only way I plan on leaving is dead in a pine box.

Our area would be impacted with high tension wires, compromised wells, disruption of businesses, lives , tourism, and flood plain risks for those near the project. The water quality feeding the reservoir which feeds NYC will be disturbed. If water temperatures are warmer bacteria grows. Like Texas this past winter, their system was damaged resulting in loss of power for days in freezing temperatures. 
The only thing green about this for profit project is the green in the pockets of the outfit proposing the underground hydroelectric project.

Please do not let this happen. We lost a whole town when the reservoir was built. We do not such development again.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am a fulltime resident of Olive, NY and I am deeply concerned and opposed to the woefully flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains, my home. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the treasured environment, highly disruptive to me, my neighbors, and other local communities, as well as presenting a significant risk to the quality NYC’s drinking water.

I am well aware of the need for additional sources of energy to meet the increasing demands of our society. This proposal is not the way to do it, not by any means. The environmental devastation, social disruption, and host of other negatives far outweigh the benefits this hydroelectric power plant would provide.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.

It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect.

Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the destructive proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains.

I grew up and spent my childhood on my family&#39;s farm at 1118 Woodland Valley Rd., where an enormous dam threatens to carve out and flood the Esopus. Us residents of Woodland Valley are no stranger to our ecosystem and community being threatened by big business and water projects. Even so, Premium Energy Savings has proposed the most invasive and radically destructive plan I have witnessed in Woodland Valley. Putting a dam in the Esopus would be detrimental to wildlife and the environment, destroying an entire community of fauna and flora in the stream.

I immensely worry for my parents who have lived in Woodland Valley for most of their life and have built a community there. We hosted a 4H Club for over a decade where local youth got hands-on experience with farming and agriculture. My mother continues to use the land and raises some livestock and my father grows much of our food in our garden. I fear for my parent&#39;s safety with a power plant obliterating the Esopus, potentially flooding our home and destroying an ecosystem. This invasion has no place in our community. 

Our property floods most summers from rain storms, and I can only imagine how a massive reservoir would corrode or destroy our house and neighbors&#39;. Premium Energy Holdings&#39;s plan is purely big business, and happily uses our community and the environment as collateral. It is not a realistic or safe plan, and will have a catastrophic impact on our road. 

It&#39;s a toxic plan that will have unforeseeable consequences on our ecosystem for decades. FERC must decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

The flawed application should be denied for multiple reasons, including:

The project would disrupt the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve, 700,000 acres of critical habitat in an increasingly fragmented world. Any feasible site in the Catskills would impinge on USGS-designated Status 2 land. Federal policy directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development.
The proposed project will severely disrupt streams within the Ashokan watershed, and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir itself—which serves as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for 9 million New York residents.
The flawed application misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design, which means it has worse environmental impacts than closed-loop hydroelectric projects.
The project raises numerous legal issues regarding States’ rights and land preservation.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to voice strong opposition to Docket P-15056-000 Ashokan Pumped Storage Project submitted by Premium Energy Holding, LLC.  Our family would be directly impacted by the proposed reservoir planned for Woodland Valley.  Our property at 624 Woodland Valley Road, Phoenicia, New York, held in the family and occupied since the 1830’s, would be sacrificed for the construction of the proposed reservoir.  I am a member of Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, 20 acres in size, and my extended family owns Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, approximately 105 acres in size, and Botchford Heritage Preservation, LLC, approximately 60 acres in size, which are under permanent conservation easement with New York City Department of Environmental Protection.  These properties are bordered by New State Forever Wild Lands and other lands owned by NYC DEP.  All of these land designations would be make it illegal to obtain under eminent domain and would be illegal to develop under current New York State Law.  The proposal is ill-conceived, would pose great risk to New York City’s unfiltered drinking water system, would irreparably harm local communities, would significantly impact valuable recreational fisheries and the local tourism economy, would negatively impact New York’s decarbonization objectives on balance, and would degrade an irreplaceable valley of global significance.  For these many significant impacts and flaws, I urge you to reject Premium Energy Holding’s preliminary permit request.

Beyond the loss of our family property invaluable to me and my family, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC proposed reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to New York City DEP’s unfiltered water via numerous acute short-term and chronic long-term impacts. Our property, most of which is under Conservation Easement with NYC DEP to protect quality, and the larger Woodland Creek watershed, currently serve an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water supply for New York City via their contribution to the high- water quality currently found in Woodland Valley Creek, several tributaries and wetlands located on the property, and the local groundwater sources.  The proposed reservoir and pumped storage operation would highly alter and negatively impact all of these important hydrological resources.  Construction of the reservoir dam, associated blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnels, land clearing and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for many years.  The proposed construction of a receiving reservoir adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir would double the impact via these acute disturbances and associated turbidity to the New York City unfiltered drinking water supply, therefore the proposal is far too risky to approve.

But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the proposed reservoir site within Woodland Valley is highly problematic.  This proposed site contains numerous natural deposits of glacial clay, which when eroded periodically by Woodland Creek produce high levels of turbidity within Woodland Creek and Esopus Creek.  The daily fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley.  The proposal has not identified this risk to Ashokan reservoir, which provides 40% of the unfiltered drinking water to 9 million New York State residents.  Operation of the proposed hydropower pump storage reservoir typically results in reservoir water levels fluctuating greatly over the course of a day in response to energy needs.  This frequent reservoir fluctuation, however, will cause bank erosion, and stream bank and stream bed erosion by Woodland Creek at the reservoir inlet will contribute to much greater and more frequent inputs of fine sediment and turbidity into the proposed reservoir, Woodland Creek, and ultimately into Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir.  

The proposed reservoir site is currently unstable and prone to erosion and heavy turbidity events.  The Ashokan Stream Management Program’s Woodland Creek Stream Management Plan from 2015 https://www.dropbox.com/s/bnw0t97tb7cfb1j/Woodland%20Creek%20SMP.pdf?dl=0
determined that 49% of the total stream length of Woodland Creek was not stable, but needed assisted restoration or full restoration in order to reduce bank erosion and stream instability. Creation of the proposed reservoir, a massive disruption to stream equilibrium, will increase erosion rates of stream banks upstream of the proposed reservoir pool, thereby increasing fine sediment and turbidity inputs into Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir.   The Ashokan Stream Management Program’s Woodland Creek Stream Management Plan notes each of the 7 management units along 6.3 miles of Woodland Creek assessed in 2015 contain multiple deposits of lacustrine clay, but these colloidal clay deposits are particularly problematic for NYC DEP reservoir management in the Ashokan, and heavy amounts of these suspended clay particles have necessitated the use of alum by NYC DEP to ensure clarity for drinking water delivery over time, therefore, these clay deposits will be mobilized with much greater frequency from greater stream instability.  How would the proposed hydropower pump storage project therefore manage or mitigate chronic turbidity impacts that would risk significantly threatening the ability of NYC DEP to achieve its drinking water supply objectives, and meet the terms of the 2017 Filtration Avoidance Determination?

Secretary Kimberly Bose 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, NE
Washington, DC 20426 

Dear Secretary Bose,

I am writing to raise concerns about Premium Energy&#39;s proposal, docket # P-15056, to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir as its lower reservoir. This proposal does not meet the FERC standard for granting a preliminary license. As an environmental journalist, I am aware of the critical importance of energy storage to our increasingly renewable grid, and am in favor of new pumped storage plants. However, we should not let our haste to build storage capacity blind us to the problems with this proposal.

Key ways the proposal is deficient:

1. Premium Energy seems completely unaware that their proposed project is situated in a highly protected State Forest Preserve, and--like any conceivable project damming a valley in the Catskill Forest Preserve--would necessitate the taking of state land via eminent domain. The Catskill Forest Preserve, created in 1885, is enshrined in the New York State constitution, which states that the land in the preserve &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; Removing any of these lands from this level of preservation for any purpose requires a state constitutional amendment, voted on and approved by two consecutive sessions of the state legislature, then submitted to a statewide referendum. Of the 2000 amendments proposed in this way since the formation of the Preserve, only 20 have passed. Premium Energy&#39;s proposal seems based on the unlikely assumption that such a state constitutional amendment will pass.

2. Premium Energy seems unaware that to develop land in such a highly protected area goes against the Department of Energy&#39;s own statement of mission. Any conceivable reservoir project inside the Catskill State Forest Preserve would impinge on highly protected state land in the Catskills that is considered Status 2 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the Department of Energy&#39;s own &#34;Hydropower Vision&#34; report of 2016, &#34;areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.&#34; 

3. Premium Energy states that this proposal is for a &#34;closed-loop&#34; project. Clearly they are calling it such because the Department of Energy has an interest in supporting closed loop projects. However, the system Premium Energy describes is NOT  a closed-loop system. It is an add-on project to an existing reservoir that is continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature. According the Department of Energy Report &#34;A Comparison of the Environmental Effects of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower&#34; (2020), add-on systems have initial construction impacts that are lower than open-loop systems, but &#34;operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for closed-loop projects because the add-on project&#39;s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the naturally flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.&#34; Premium Energy&#39;s proposal engages in a concerning level of misdirection and falsification.

4. The naturally flowing water feature that was originally dammed to construct the Ashokan Reservoir is Esopus Creek, which is not only an asset of high environmental value in the Catskills ecosystem, but is part of the New York City water supply, the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and an infrastructure asset worth tens of billions of dollars to the city of New York. The quality of this water supply is governed by a regularly updated Filtration Avoidance Determination issued by the EPA. The most recent EPA FAD of 2017 included the implementation of turbidity reduction measures and the continuation of monitoring of these measures by an expert panel at the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. The fact that Premium Energy appears completely ignorant of these additional protections to the water supply, and has not addressed how turbidity would be affected by a pumped storage project on the reservoir, suggests a total failure to understand both the complex ecosystem, and the complex regulatory environment in which they are proposing to work.

5. That complex regulatory environment also includes the Delaware River Basin Compact, a federal-interstate agency created in 1961, to which many Catskills towns, including the town of Shandaken, home to two of Premium Energy&#39;s alternative reservoir sites, are signatories. Article 9, Section 2 of the DRBC states that &#34; The commission may develop and operate, or authorize to be developed and operated, dams and related facilities and appurtenances for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power and hydroelectric energy.&#34; At the very least, the failure to notify the DRBC of the plan means that Premium Energy is inadequate on FERC Section 4.32 II C.

6. Premium Energy failed to notify Greene County (inadequate on 4.32 II A), the Greene County Soil and Conservation District (inadequate on 4.32 II C), the town of Hunter (inadequate on 4.32 II D).

7. The application if also deficient in its failure to provide specifications of the existing dam, the dividing weir (of which they seem totally unaware) or the spillway in the existing Ashokan Reservoir (inadequate on 4.81 VII A 1 a-e.

7. A host of other problems with the proposal--blurry maps utilizing outdated topographic views, GPS locations that don&#39;t match up with the maps or the narrative--suggest that this proposal was hurriedly and carelessly created. This is not the kind of work that should be allowed to proceed in land as highly protected as the Catskill Forest Preserve and the New York City watershed. I respectfully request that FERC deny this preliminary license application.

Sincerely yours,

(Continuation of Opposition Letter)

The proposed reservoir’s disruption of the natural sediment regime of Woodland Creek and Esopus Creek is not limited to water, but will eliminate many miles of important trout habitat needed by both of these economically important and historically famous fisheries.  Woodland Creek itself serves as an important and valued recreational resource in its current state for me and my family, but the proposed reservoir will cause irreparable harm to this this stream, eliminating 3 miles of it beneath the reservoir.  Woodland creek serves as an important spawning tributary to Esopus Creek, and the proposed reservoir would damage the valuable recreational trout fishery on Esopus Creek, as it provides critical spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek to use these fertile headwaters to spawn.  A proposed reservoir at 300 feet in height would form a complete fish passage barrier to upstream movement and migration of trout and other fish species.  The migratory trout of the Ashokan Reservoir/Esopus Creek system is a world-famous wild rainbow trout fishery that generates significant dollars in local economic activity as a recreation destination, but the proposed dam but would force the complete loss of access for trout to more than 5 miles of Woodland Creek, which is classified as Trout Spawning by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC), and 8 miles of tributary habitat, which is classified as Brook Trout habitat by NYC DEC.  This complete severance of more than 13 miles of trout habitat to spawning and rearing habitat of the larger Esopus Creek system would negatively impact the trout population and degrade this popular and acclaimed recreational fishery. 

If the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed reservoir construction and operation.  The reservoir would damage this highly-valued coldwater aquatic ecosystem and trout fishery with increased summer water temperatures caused by solar radiation of the reservoir surface.  Has the applicant recognized to the potential negative effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout fishery?  How would these be mitigated? They cannot be replaced.

As New York State begins to activate on its statewide decarbonization goals, this proposed project would apply to destroy hundreds of acres of intact, highly functioning forest and soils that are sequestering carbon.  Has the applicant defined the amount of carbon loss that would occur from the elimination of hundreds of acres of forest for the two proposed reservoir pools, the thousands of acres of forest and soil disturbance from associated development or roads and infrastructure, and the installation of many miles of powerline infrastructure?  As a society, we need to protect and increase the health and function of these forests so they can help our country sequester carbon and ultimately mitigate climate change.  What are the carbon costs to the state for the construction of the 300 foot tall concrete dams? What are the carbon costs associated with the electricity needed to pump water to the upper reservoir over the life of the project?  All of these questions need to be answered before claiming the project will not be contributing to carbonization of the atmosphere and the associated negative impacts on New York State from a changing climate.

Finally, Woodland Valley and the Upper Esopus Creek are confirmed be a circular drainage formed by an ancient asteroid impact, representing a unique geologic phenomenon of global significance (NASA 1992), but Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a potential pumped storage reservoir, tunnel drilling, infrastructure and associated land disturbance fails to recognize this outstanding and rare designation. The Panther Mountain circular drainage, formed approximately 375 million years ago, represents one of only a handful of such places on earth.  The Panther Mountain watershed including Woodland Valley should be designated a world heritage site and be afforded the protection from large scale development as proposed by Premium Energy Holding.

For all of these reasons described above, I urge you to reject Premium Energy Holding’s proposed preliminary application for Docket P-15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

I am in support of this concept, however there are some concerns with this project. The need for this type of project is important to support the development of renewable energy generation. As a Certified Energy Manager I am have a good understand of the energy needs of this state and country and the efficient utilization of energy.  Pumped storage is a proven technology and once constructed is environmentally friendly. 
As a frequent visitor to state public lands, my major concern of this project is the impact on public lands. The Catskill Park is protected by the State Constitution to be forever wild.  Additionally this land is open for all visitors to enjoy.  Any pumped storage project must maintain this public access to state lands.  While some people feel flooding of this land by such a project violates the State Constitution, I see it as a benefit as long as the newly created lake becomes publicly accessible both that on current public land and that land purchased for this project for the purpose of creating the upper reservoir. Additionally, any new infrastructure (Dams, Intakes, Pumps, pipelines and transmission lines, etc.) must be located on land that is not currently protected state land.  If any state land is required it must be replaced with a greater amount and value of land being used for this project. Such a land swap must be achieved through a statewide ballot refrendum to amend the State Constitution.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Michelle Koval under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I’m writing to OPPOSE the Proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant, FERC project number, P-15056.
I agree we should be finding new and better ways to use renewable energy and a storage plant does sound useful, the Catskill Mountains are not feasible for several reasons. It will hurt the tourism economy, displace people who won’t be able to afford or find housing in the area, be devastating to the environment and risky for the purity of NYC ‘s drinking water.

*Being retired we’ve traveled to the Catskills’area four to five times a year from our home in Wisconsin for more than ten years, spending our only tourism dollars at Orchards, Restaurants, Stores and Parks, Vacation Rentals and Hotels. New York’s Economy depends on visitors, with 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019 bringing in 1.6 billion dollars and supporting 20,000 jobs. 43% of that market being Ulster County. Second Homes generate $360 million in economic activity. (Source: Tourism Economics, “Economic Impact of Tourism in NY”, 2019.) 
Whichever proposed area you use would have a negative impact on the tourism of the area, due to the construction, lane closures, etc. I can’t imagine miles of cement trucks and construction vehicles even driving on the twisty roads through the forest, bumper to bumper up and down the narrow roads in the area. 
*With the real estate values almost double in the last three years in the Catskills area and New York City workers realizing this two-hour drive from their corporate offices provides the perfect placement of their work from home offices, this trend will continue, unless of course, they must relocate their homes and business with this plan. Displaced families may very likely find that they can no longer afford the area.
Since the beginning of time the Catskills have been home to people who care for and about this land. Walking the trails in the parks you feel the presence of the Esopus Tribe of Native Americans and know that you are seeing the land as they saw it. Upstate New Yorkers, and visitors are privileged to have this place to be in nature and with nature close to how it once was and they respect it, and it is to be RESPECTED by all.
*This must be what inspired them to, in 1885 create The Catskills Forest Preserve and later to PROTECT it. It enchants visitors and residents with 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region wide according to New York State Forest Condition Index. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 Land under USGS” Gap Analysis Project”. According to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under USGS Gap Analysis Program are AVOIDED for development”.
*Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

*According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line - Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then summited to the public in a referendum. 

One reason for all of this is to protect the land, wildlife, the birds, which fall within Audubon’s Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area, and the trout waters in the Esopus River. The trout breeding habitat would be lost if this proposed project goes through. Not to mention the historical buildings that may be lost in the area.

* A pumped storage upper reservoir will be subject to rapid fluctuations of water which will severely damage both land and aquatic habitats. The sediment regime will be altered in tributaries to the Esopus River and also the NYC water supply!

*Forty per cent of NYC’s water supply, provides 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people that will be impacted, according to the DEP.  When the Ashokan Reservoir was built 25 communities were displaced and billions of dollars were invested, $1.7 billion since 1990’s alone. It’s currently the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation and it currently meets the needs of NYC but it must be protected. Climate change evaporation, heat events, and decreasing snowpack already produce uncertainty and adding a storage plant will produce turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir that will greatly affect its water quality.

*And lastly, the Department of Energy prefers closed-loop projects that have smaller environmental impact and may be eligible for streamlined FERC approval, but adding to the existing lower Ashokan Reservoir/Watershed will be an add-on project, not a closed-loop project. 
By Premium Energy lying in their application, to the public and FERC, with their sole purpose of being fast tracked for approval, they are telling us they cannot be trusted in anything they promise to do. 

Transitioning to renewable, green-energy sources must not devastate this pristine environment! 
One hundred years ago, 25 communities were affected by the building of the Ashokan Reservoir and people are still not over it. If you must affect the lives of several more communities for generations, choose an area that is not as beautiful and cherished by so many. And at least do not re-traumatize the same people!
PE should follow the Department of Energy’s Hydropower plan, and the NYS Constitution and don’t create mistrust by lying.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
Beth Lamberty

I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. DOCKET# P-15056. 

The company in question is being duplicitous about its intentions in order to ram through this shoddy project.
Premium is claiming to be “closed-loop.” project. 
Closed loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. Contrarily, projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as
“add-on” projects; that’s what this really is. They are lying.  

This project will be devastating, not only to The Catskill Preserve, but also to its wildlife, the surrounding water systems, all the residents of the area, the thousands upon thousands of tourists who visit this pristine and beautiful area every year (which is an economic boon to the area) and the millions of New York City residents, whose drinking water will be adversely effected. 

According to the DEP. The Ashokan Reservoir and watershed, provides 40% of NYC’s water, a water supply that provides 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people. This valuable capital asset, represents $1.7 billion since the 1990s alone. Another reason that this economically unsound project should be denied.

‘The Environmental Species Act’ protects much of the wildlife on this preserve. Which is yet another reason to deny Premium.

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the Catskill Preserve lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest 
lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
FERC cannot selectively choose if they will abide by the NY State Constitution.

It is for all these reasons (stated above) that I vehemently oppose this proposal. It must be struck down. I Vote NO!

Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose

We are submitting these comments on behalf of the Coalition to Save Catskill Preserve.

The Coalition is a newly formed grass-roots network composed of a growing number of residents and community groups of the Catskill Region of New York State and their allies.  In our dedication to protecting the environment, wildlife, recreation, cultural heritage and local communities, we are expressing profoundly serious concerns with the deeply flawed proposal submitted to FERC by Premium Energy Holdings to construct a hydroelectric plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains
  
The Coalition now consists of more than 200 members from the region and 20 organizations and is growing daily. Coalition members live both in and out of the region and are dedicated to protecting the ecology and history of the Catskill Preserve from misguided and inappropriate exploitation of this area, as exemplified by the Premium proposal.

This project must be rejected because it would disrupt the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve, 700,000 acres of critical habitat in an increasingly fragmented world. 

Any feasible site in the Catskills would impinge on USGS-designated Status 2 land. Federal policy directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development.



Furthermore
•	Implementation of this project would require a NYS Constitutional Amendment requiring passage of both Houses of New York State Legislature, a public vote, and a sign off by the Governor. 

•	It will flood over 200 acres of private land and protected state forests to construct a new reservoir

•	The new reservoir would be connected to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel up to 50 feet wide and many miles long, drilled under both public and private lands, and the erection of at least 12.9 miles of 230kV high-tension transmission lines.

•	The project will threaten endangered species, impact the NYC water supply, discourage tourism, and have a serious negative economic impact on the region

•	It will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for over 9 million New York residents. 

•	It will severely disrupt existing regional wells and septic systems which in turn will negatively affect the quality of water regionally and in New York City.  

•	Premium Energy misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.

•	The project would require the seizing of many private parcels via eminent domain, the devaluation of even more additional private parcels and the construction of a massive concrete dam up to 300 feet tall. 

•	The applicant, Premium Energy, has failed in its due diligence obligations. They have made numerous factual errors and omissions in both the original and amended application. They are clearly unqualified to design, construct or maintain a project of this scope.  

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, and negatively impact the drinking water of over 9 million New Yorkers.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

The environmental destruction of protected lands and economic and social disruption from this project far outweigh the purported benefits. The project only benefits Premium Energy, while severely degrading the local area. It is uncertain whether or not it would actually lower energy costs.   

Commenters have been advised that FERC does not weigh harmful human and social damage of proposed projects, which is in itself appalling. However please consider that when the Ashokan Reservoir was constructed between 1907 and 1915,  the New York City Board of Water Supply impounded the Esopus Creek, submerging thousands of acres of farmland. The impoundment covered twelve communities located in a valley where farming, logging, and quarrying prevailed. Approximately two thousand residents along with roads, homes, shops, farms, churches, and mills were either moved or abandoned, but most of them were torn down. Substantial bitterness remains among the residents of these towns whose families and ancestors were so cavalierly dislocated. 

The massive statutory and procedural barriers to implementation of this project indicate protracted, expensive legal proceedings for Premium Energy and it&#39;s legions of opponents. 

Please reject this outrageous application to destroy natural areas for corporate profit.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Linda Meyers under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Linda Meyers, Chichester, NY.

I am a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County, and I am writing to strongly oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I support our nation’s transition to renewable energy, I believe the Catskills region is not the right location for such a project as it will significantly impact state preserved forest land, streams, species, and the New York City water supply. The harm that would be done is unlawful and in violation of the New York State Constitution. Further, Premium Energy does not provide the kind of innovation sought by the Department of Energy as its proposal is deficient and misleading. Premium Energy’s claim that it will build a closed loop-system is false. Their proposal is actually an open loop system, an add-on project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source.  As you know, the environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 

The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve (established 1885). This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Any changes in the management of State Forest Preserves have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum. Otherwise, it is unlawful and unconstitutional. Furthermore, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report, areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.

I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy’s proposal; and DoE’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydro electric power plant in the heart of the Catskills Mountains in New York. I desperately urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment. 
I am a resident here and am thus learning as much as I can about both hydroelectric power and the appropriateness of such a plant in this place, which is protected by its &#34;forever wild&#34; status. It says in the NYS Constitution that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Given this, and the special, uniqueness of the environment- The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat which is very rare and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. There are other reasons, including the fact that I, and my neighbors, as residents of one of the proposed sites- would be displaced and our community would be destroyed. I have no idea how we would be able to  secure new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. 
I sincerely hope that our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources does not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
I implore you to do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.
Thank you.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I am writing to object to the flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to reject Premium&#39;s application for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The application is facially defective and the proposed project would devastate the environment, the local communities, and would risk the purity of NYC’s drinking water.  Pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects may play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, but the constitutionally protected Catskill Forest Preserve is not the right place for one. 

	1) Article XIV of the NYS Constitution guarantees that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Changes. if any, to the status of this land would require a constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions of the state legistalure and then subnmitted to a public vote by referendum.

	2)  Contrary to the description in Premium&#39;s application, this is not a closed-loop project, which is the kind of project the Department of Energy wants to see due to its lower environmental impacts.  It is an add-on project, using an existing body of water as the lower reservoir.  Add-on projects have significantly higher risks.  The Esopus Creek and other streams flow into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir (which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people). The  proposed project would therefore directly interact with an unfiltered public water source. Since the Catskills are within a State Forest Preserve, they are designated Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. The Department of Energy&#39;s own materials on hydropower state a clear preference for closed-loop and not add-on projects and indicate that development of Status 1 or 2 lands should be avoided.  

	3)  Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters.  Water level fluctuations would also increase turbidity within the Reservoir itself.  NYC is not presently required to filter the Ashokan water pursuant to long-standing EPA consent to the New York City Filtration Avoidance Program (FAD).  EPA&#39;s consent was just renewed in December 2017.  If Premium&#39;s application were to be granted, this would potentially create a conflict between the positions taken by two federal agencies.

	4)  Ulster County should not have been the only county notified of Premium&#39;s proposal.  The proposed Stony Clove Reservoir actually falls within the Town of Hunter in Greene County.  Upon information and belief, Greene County was never notifed of Premium&#39;s application, rendering it defective on its face.

	5) In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, requiring the seizing of private property by eminent domain in any of the locations proposed by Premium. Displaced residents would have difficulty securing new, affordable housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County.  There would also be a negative effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs.

The Catskills are a special place; one that I have frequented with family and friends for years. The natural environment is an incredible resource, as is the gateway communities that provide access to it. This proposal, for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Plan, seems to take all of that for granted.

That it has been filed without input by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation or the New York City Department of Environmental Protection is unsurprising as the impact of the construction of new dams, power lines, and tunnels on the local communities and critical wildlife habitat seems totally unconsidered.

That is has been summarily opposed by local government and the region&#39;s outdoor community is less surprising. The impacts on tourism and recreation—of incredible importance to the Catskills in all seasons—are potentially devastating. 

I&#39;m writing in total opposition to this plan and ask that it rejected immediately.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Season Daniels under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Season Daniels, Olivebridge, NY.

[PREFACE: According to an article in the Kingston Daily Freeman, Premium Energy Holdings is going to withdraw their current proposal and submit a new proposal seeking evaluation of a different upper reservoir site in an unknown location. However, I remain vehemently against any hydroelectric project in the Catskills Forest Preserve, especially involving the Ashokan Reservoir for reasons following.]
===========================================

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in regard to Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant in at the Ashokan Reservoir, docket P-15056. I am a resident of Phoenicia, NY and I am strongly opposed to the proposal. 

The proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings states that this is a closed-loop system, when clearly it is not: the proposal is to add a new reservoir built at one of three possible sites to connect to the Ashokan Reservoir, the largest source of unfiltered water in the nation and supplier of 40% of New York City’s water needs. This haphazard and deceptive description of the project by the California-based company should be enough to disqualify them from undertaking such a project where they have no interest other than profit. 

The nature of this type of project would be permanently devastating to the environment and wildlife, and therefore the livelihood of the local economy, which depends so much on the tourism that the beauty of this area attracts. 

The rapidly fluctuating water levels would destroy the natural habitats of so many vital and endangered species, including trout, turtles, bald eagle and many others. It would greatly increase turbidity of the tributaries of the Ashokan Reservoir, jeopardizing water quality for millions of New York City residents. Not addressed in the proposal is investigating the effects of such a project on the local groundwater table that supplies water to most of the area’s residents and businesses. 

Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the Catskills Forest Preserve, created in 1885, “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, and then submitted to the public in a referendum. The effort to push this project through will be a long and costly process that should ultimately fail. This is not just a local concern, and will bring widespread opposition. 

I understand the vital benefit offered by pumped-storage hydroelectric plants to reduce the daily demand for fossil fuel-generated power, but for the reasons stated above (and stated by so many other concerned citizens) the Catskill region and New York City water supply are inappropriate for this type of project.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely yours,
Benjamin Jackson</pre><hr><b>Comments of Mary Strauhs under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mary Strauhs, Olivebridge, NY.

My name is Jason Kurtz and I am a resident of West Shokan, NY.  I recently became aware of the proposal by Premium Energy entitled “Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.”  I was surprised by many aspects of this proposal because of the immense ramifications on so many levels. Simply put, Premium Energy does not deserve the special consideration FERC may give to closed-loop projects. For starters, these highly preserved state lands are kept so for important ecological reasons, most notably the important bird and fish wildlife habitats. This highly preserved land has been so since 1885, when the NYS Constitution declared this 700K acres of continuous wildlife habitat of Catskills forest be “forever kept as wild.” As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program – and the DEP has said land areas designated as Status 1 or 2 will be “avoided for development.” If this proposal did in fact get any traction, it would have to be passed by a constitutional amendment by the NYS Constitution, voted on by two consecutive sessions in state legislature and then submitted to the public for referendum. Is Premium Energy even aware they are proposing a project in such a protected environment? Also, please note, this proposal by Premium Energy is not factual. This proposal is NOT for a closed-loop project, it is an add-on project since an upper reservoir would be added on to a lower reservoir – so this proposal is, in fact, deficient and misleading. This proposed project cannot happen. Thank you.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marie Cieri under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/9/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marie Cieri, Lanesville, NY.

Dear Ms. Bose:

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there are currently housing shortages in Ulster County and Greene County, and, for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster and Greene Counties and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Taking all this into account, I hope you will deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

I strongly object to the proposed Ashokan Pump Storage Project. 
There will be environmental degradation, there will be the possibility of accidents which could possibly affect hundreds of thousands of people.
This project is a grab,by an out of state company, for enormous profit at the expense of New Yorkers.
The 21 century is on the cutting edge of new energy producing technology. We don&#39;t need a variation on old school technology to foul our land. Be forward thinking.
This project will be fought tooth and nail and is dead on arrival.

RE: The proposed Ashokan Reservoir Pumped Storage and Hydro-electric Project
        Docket P-15056
 
Dear Commissioners:  

	The Mountain Top Progressives (MTP) is an environmental activist group of 400 residents of seven Towns, several Villages, and a number of Hamlets who call the Mountaintop home. Located in Greene County, our communities stretch from Hunter on the South and East to Windham on the North and East. Traveling west on Route 23A in the South and on Route 23 in the North, we get to the western border at Prattsville - at the Gilboa Dam and the Schoharie Watershed Reservoir – all part of the NYC-DEP Watershed.  We are, for the most part, located within the Catskill Forest Preserve.  We write today in response to a proposed 2-year study put forth by Premium Energy Holdings LLC of California as indicated above.  In doing so, we join in protest with a massive number of local and State Government Officials within the proposed project area. These include our own Mountaintop Town governments, Officials in both impacted Counties - Ulster and Greene Counties - as well as our NY State Representatives – State Senator Michelle Hinchey and Assembly Member Chris Tague. This list includes the Mountaintop Town Supervisors, the Mayor’s Mountaintop Coalition, and the Coalition of Watershed Towns. 

Awareness of this proposal was delayed for some reason, yet a broad range of community organizations have also added their opposition as well.  These include the Sierra Club, the Catskill Center, the Catskill Mountain Keeper, the Catskill 3500 Club, the Ashokan Center, Trout Unlimited, the River keeper, the Mountaintop Arboretum, and many other entities who have expressed opposition to this proposal. As the Mountain Top Progressives, we join in voicing our concern and our position encouraging you to reject this proposal.  The following is a list of major reasons that have provoked our opposition. 

1.	HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION – COMMENTARY.

Given the need for power generation, many alternative options present themselves. Hydro-electric power is just one of those.  Although far more attractive than burning coal or other fossil-based petroleum non-sustainable products to generate power, other less intrusive options – solar, wind, and nuclear sustainable sources are also options.  Which options are sustainable, attractive, efficient, and less intrusive in a given environment or location raises serious concerns regarding this proposed project study.  Compared to both solar and wind generation, this hydro-electric pumped project is a far more intrusive and destructive proposal.  The required construction results in disturbing, altering, or destroying the surrounding environment. Such an action also results in an erosion of regional economic attraction as well as recreational tourist access. Aside from carbon-based energy generation, this proposal is the least attractive compared to the other sustainable options.  As water is pumped-up to the flow-down reservoir with a 215-225 foot dam and hundreds of submerged acres, piping installation and more, the power required to pump water to a higher altitude in order to create a return flow over turbines is far less productive than solar and wind stations. Further, such an undertaking is far more expensive to construct and substantially intrusive within the host environment.  

2.	THREE OPTIONAL SITES FOR STUDY – INCLUDING STONY CLOVE NOTCH, HUNTER

The Catskill Mountains – particularly the Northern Catskills – are largely contained in the CATSKILL FOREST PRESERVE. Established in the NY State Constitution in the 19th Century, this 700,000 acre “preserve” was designed to protect the forest and the environmental flora and fauna, provide tourist access and recreational opportunity for visitors, and grow appreciation for the beauty and vistas that have been enjoyed for generations.  Mountaintop tourism was ignited and launched in the 1830-50s by the HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL OF ART led by artists like Thomas Cole, Asher Duran, Frederic Church, and others.  Their landscape artwork toured the US and Europe as well and generated much visitor interest in personally exploring “the Mountaintop.”  One of the well-known pieces of art, in fact, depicts Stony Clove Notch - one of three selected optional sites for the construction of a dam and reservoir, including a 225 foot tall dam, installation of flow pipes and pumps, acres of land absorbed, and Rt. 214 cut-off and closed. The Stony Clove site, although an attractive option with the highest altitude of the three sites presented, is within the Catskill Forest Preserve. Stony Clove features the Devil’s Tombstone Campground – one of the oldest camps in the Catskills and among the most active. It is an access point to numerous trailheads including Devil’s Path and the famous Long Path. This historic location may very well be denied access, devastated, drowned, or destroyed by the project. 

ROAD ACCESS FROM THE SOUTH: Access to the entire Mountaintop from a single southern access road – Route 214 – is also destroyed in this option with the creation of a remote receiving reservoir at Stony Clove Notch.  The road closure of Route 214 as shown on the maps contained in the proposal severs the road connections between Phoenicia (Ulster County) and Hunter (at Lanesville – a village of Hunter in Greene County, NY). Route 214 is the primary link between East/West Route 28 at Phoenicia and East/West Route 23-A located in Hunter.  This limitation on access points to the seven Mountaintop Towns - including Hunter on the southern border and Windham on the north via Route 212 - includes seven towns, several Villages, and a number of Hamlets - most in the Schoharie Watershed). East/West access to the entire Mountaintop is limited to Routes 23 and 23A. Route 212 from Rte. 23A South to Rte. 23 North connects the two.  The southern Mountaintop access connector between Route 28 (Ulster County-Phoenicia) and Route 23A (Greene County-Hunter and access to the Mountaintop) is Route 214.  If selected, the Stony Clove Notch Option would erase Route 214 – the southern access road.  

DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, HOMES, AND ACREAGE:  Once construction gets underway and the related environment, acreage, and properties are acquired, homes will disappear, farms, camps, and trails will be closed, retreats demolished, and trees removed.  Digging, installation of pipes and pumps, stoppage of streams and ponds, and the closure of roads will take place as well.  Such sacrifices and risks undertaken can forever diminish our environmental quality, our forested beauty, and our recreational opportunities and attractions. Worse, and potentially illegal, this option would invade the Catskill Forest Preserve as set aside in the NY State Constitution. This is completely unacceptable, impacting our environment, water quality, access, and attraction for visitors – the basis of our rural Mountaintop economic vitality.   

3.	ENVIRONMENTAL/WATERSHED RISKS: DISRUPTION AND DESTRUCTION.   

From flora and fauna, to fish, birds, and trees as well as to other forest growth that has reflected the policy of Forest Preservation for more than 100 years, we object to its destruction and to the accidental importation of invasive species into the our protected Forest Preserve. Further,  along with other Watershed communities, we express deep concerns regarding water quality and turbidity consequences. The long existing Watershed on the Mountaintop and between our communities and the Ashokan will be disturbed and potentially be diminished or denigrated.  

And, a further series of concerns and questions have been raised. Will clean water access via the Watershed system of collection and supply be disrupted for an inefficient hydro-electric power project that may prove to be invasive? Shall we violate the more than 100&#43; year Catskill Forest Preserve status and erode our commitment to environmental preservation for electric power with other less-intrusive options in solar and wind power? And, how desperate is the need for such a project?  

In closing, we encourage you to reject the proposed $5 million, 2-year study submitted for review by your Commission.  We have witnessed a rapid growth of community opposition as well as governmental calls for rejection from the Town Level, to the Counties involved – Greene and Ulster, and to our State Elected representatives.  And, there is no support from the NYC DEP which manages the Watershed assets, or from the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation.  Support is absent and opposition abounds.  We join in opposition. Please reject this proposed project.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First St. NE, Room 1A
Washington, D.C. 20426.
Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a
hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. As landowners, we take our responsibility to protect the birds, pollinators, wildlife, water and ecology this fragile area very seriously. I am part of a large and
engaged community and I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary
permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 based on the following
reasons:
1.) NOT CLOSED LOOP -The application is sloppy and flawed in it’s local
references and assertion of being a “closed loop system” when it is an “add
on” system.
2.) BIRDS-All proposed reservoirs are within the Audubon NY Catskill Peaks
Forest Important Bird Area (IBA). If you have ever heard the flute song of a
Forrest Thrush, you would defend it’s habitat from development without
question or hesitation. https://ny.audubon.org/conservation/catskill-peaksforest
3.) TROUT -The system’s environmental impact on the sediment regime in the
Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters,
and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir.
4.) DRINKING WATER - The system’s impact on turbidity levels of the Ashokan
Reservoir which supplies both local and 40% of NYC’s water, serving 1 billion
gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. The proposal threatens this
valuable asset, which holds the distinction of being the largest unfiltered
water supply in the nation.
5.) PRESERVED LAND -The three sites for the proposed reservoirs and tunnels
are on highly protected land of the Catskills Forrest Preserve created in 1885
under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution “shall be forever wild… not be
leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
6.) PROTECTED LAND -The Catskill Forrest Preserve is considered Status 2 land
under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the U.S. Dept. of
Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated
as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for
development.&#34;
7.) CONTINUOUS HABITAT - The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of
continuous wildlife habitat (very rare) and the forest around the proposed
sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the
New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy
this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed
precedent for protected lands across the country.
8.) COMMUNITY DISPLACEMENT, AGAIN- Premium Energy’s proposal would be
devastating to local communities as it would require the seizing of homes
and private property via eminent domain—a process whose scars are still
felt here from when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents
displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would be unable to secure
new housing, as there is currently a severe housing shortage in Ulster
County.
9.) TOURISM – The proposal would negatively impact the Catskills’ growing
tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the region in
2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium
Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of
recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty and otherwise
industrialize the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and
beyond.
As a last point to make in opposition, the irony must be pointed out that the solution
to fossil fuels and extractive energy methods should not be to usher in a new
environmentally damaging system! Our country’s transition to renewable, green energy
sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community
devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative
location for a pumped storage project—using innovation where the construction
and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable
communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter. 
All the best,

Dear Secretary Bose:
I am writing as a resident and homeowner in the area of the Catskill mountains that Premium Energy Holdings’ Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056) proposed location is.  This is my unequivocal opposition to this project, as it will decimate the ecology of the area and wrongly and tragically destroy this community and its livelihood, in addition to harmful impacts to New York City’s drinking water.  This proposed project is green-washing at its worst, which relies on an absolute desecration of this New York State protected land.  This proposal is without merit as to its location, its method and its scale.
My husband and I bought our property in order to live with nature and its simplicity, and having our now 9 year-old son grow up on this land has been our greatest joy.  Some families in our community have been here for generations, and their livelihood is based on their ingenuity and careful stewardship of the land. New York State, unlike other states, had the foresight in creating protected land that would support the natural ecology of this area.  The FERC needs to stop this proposal at its current state, as it is completely infeasible and will be found without merit – it is a waste of your agency’s resources and time.  
While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.

Their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.

Docket number P-15056-000 

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing  to say that I am against the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

When I first heard about this project,  I thought about two things.  First, on PBS last week, there was a special on climate change and it stated that deforestation was a really large reason for climate change and it cited all the deforestation in the rain forests other countries over the last several years.  It talked about how re-foresting would help fight climate change.  How can we be doing this project supposedly to help be more environmentally proactive if it would be ripping up forever wild forests and streams?  The second was a speech made by Vice President Kamala Harris in Chicago this past week that stated: &#34;In the past wars were fought over oil.  In the future, wars will be fought about water.&#34;  I thought, how can we be even considering a project that would ruin the water in the area now and in the future?  Again, in an effort to be environmentally proactive, they would be ruining the environment from a water perspective also.  This would involve killing fish and other wildlife. 

In our area, we have to obtain permission to do just about anything with our water ecosystem. Home owners have to conform to guidelines to protect the watershed, which ultimately affects the NYC water supply.  How can this project ,which would totally rip up the land are affect the streams that run into the Ashokan Reservoir, be proposed without giving a heads up to the NYC water supply authorities and the community governments and planning boards?  Why would they NOT do that?

Later, I wondered how we would get from the Shokan area over the mountain to Peekamoose /  Sundown  / Grahamsville without going all the way around via 28 to 209 to 55, which is about twice the amount of time.  Watson Hollow Road, the road that passes near Moonhaw, is the only road over that mountain.

This project would devastate our environment, our local communities, and the purity of NYC’s drinking water.  The project might in theory be an environmentally proactive project but at what cost. This will forever ruin protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat..  The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Please don&#39;t destroy this beautiful preserved land.

There would be even MORE environmental devastation after construction is complete.  The Ashokan watershed and its rivers and streams would all be affected. Pumped storage will ruin stream ecology,   aquatic habitats and land habitats.  When the water is pumped up and down in the project, it will affect wildlife and the sediment in connected tributaries.  The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have farther reaching effects,  affecting the sediment in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir.  

This will affect the NYC water supply! The Ashokan Reservoir supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.  Because the Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system —it is an “add-on” -- the water fluctuations would increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed.  The Ashokan Reservoir is a valuable asset.  It is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities.  The project in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain.  We already had this happen when the Ashokan Reservoir was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would have a hard time buying new housing.  Because of the pandemic, housing prices are high and houses are in short supply in Ulster County and the surrounding areas. 

This past year, the entire world shut down and the economy of the area was devastated by the shutdown.  Things are finally starting to open and customers are finally coming out again improving the tourism economy.  In 2019, tourism generated almost 20 percent of the jobs in the Catskill region,  a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. The numbers this year for hiking, biking fishing and other outdoor activities were so much larger this year because of the pandemic.  Experts predict this trend will continue due to the movement of NYC residents to our area.  Please don&#39;t let the Premium Energy’s project ruin this revitalized recreation in the Catskills.  

I don&#39;t understand why they are not using the Closed-loop pumped system instead of the one they are proposing.  Wouldn&#39;t that have a  smaller impact?  . This project to NOT a “closed-loop” project. It is an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks and is NOT the kind of project the country needs right now.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, Docket number P-15056-000.

Docket P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose,
I am submitting the following as a resident of the town of Olive, NY which would suffer significant negative environmental impacts from the proposed project.

The following are a few of the omissions in the amended Application for Preliminary Permit proposal submitted 2/1/21:
18CFR § 4.32(a)(2)(i)(A): Greene County is not identified. (a)(2)(iii)(A) Greene County Soil and Conservation District is not identified.
4.81(b)(1) the proposal does not identify or describe the existing spillways and dividing weir at the Ashokan reservoir.
4.81(b)(6) the proposal fails to demonstrate how the proposed project would develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.

18 CFR § 4.32(j) states that “Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.” 
For this project to move forward it would require electrical transmission line studies and improvements external to the project that are yet to be done / completed. The Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) as it relates to the NYC watershed and water supply would need to be renegotiated with the USEPA before preliminary work on this project could proceed. An Amendment to the NY State Constitution would be required as well.  As all of these would occur in the future, and as the constitutional amendment and revised FAD are at the least extremely unlikely to occur, this proposal should be rejected.

Comments 
The project is an add on, open loop project, not closed loop despite being described as such, as the Esopus Creek runs into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir. The DOE has promoted closed rather than open loop projects.
The project as proposed would be powered primarily by non-renewable sources. This is counter to the intent of recent NYS Clean Energy legislation. 

Proposal Section 4: “The project would store excess renewable energy, helping to integrate renewables into the grid, and to supply firm peaking power generation with primary load following capability.”  

Renewables make up about 6% of NY Downstate region generation. NYISO seasonal load profiles show that peak demand is not concurrent with PV production, rather it occurs during evening hours when 94% of generation is from fossil fuels (69%) / nuclear power (25%). Likewise only 1.6% of upstate (not local) wind energy was curtailed (2019) due to capacity / transmission issues. Economics point to pumping during late night hours when demand is lowest, utilizing no PV generation and little if any wind generation.

Further, NYS utilities have argued before FERC that incentives for additional generation in the downstate region are unnecessary due to ongoing and planned transmission upgrades.

Hello, I am writing as a resident of Shandaken, NY to express my opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny their application for a preliminary permit.

If constructed, the proposed project would damage local lands, roads, and streams in a way that would permanently damage a crucial piece of the Catskills. Route 214, a scenic byway and one of the sites the company is exploring, would almost certainly have to be re-routed which would be devastating to tourism and outdoor activities. Route 214 is a key access road for skiing at Hunter and Windham mountains, and is the only place to access world famous Catskills ice climbing - limiting traffic or re-routing this road would remove access to hundreds of ice climbing routes within Stony Clove and Deep Notch which would negatively impact outdoor enthusiasts and ice climbers (including myself), local guiding and rental businesses, and local bars and restaurants.

If constructed, the proposed project would also be illegal. New York State is the largest property owner within the Catskills and pursuant to Article XIV, Section 1 of the New York State constitution, the lands of the state “shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private” - the proposed upper reservoir would be located within the lands that this article applies to. With this in mind, even allowing for preliminary permits would mean a pointless disruption to important part of the Catskills, as the project would not be approved.

Even allowing for preliminary permits would negatively impact Route 214, a critical and scenic byway connecting towns with outdoor activities, would lead to a loss of tourist dollars and business revenue, and could have impact on streams that would affect fishing, boating, and swimming. I ask you to consider all these factors and deny the preliminary permits for this ill-planned project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marcy Berman-Billig under P-15056.

What a amazing wonder NY state has created in the form of the Ashokan Dam Rail Trail. We have enjoyed walking, biking and skiing along this trail along with many other nature lovers. I would suggest that it is a GREAT draw for NY state tourism, we certainly brought our business to the region to enjoy the beauty of this treasure along Route 28.

This new project would disturb the pristine forest that surrounds the trail, would potentially affect streams and even the NYC reservoir watershed. I am absolutely opposed to sending high voltage wires over Route 28. The spectacular views of the historic Catskill mountains would be marred. 

Please do not allow this project to proceed!

Hello, I am writing as a homeowner in Shandaken, NY to strongly oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I am very much in favor of moving towards renewable energy, the Catskills is not the right location for this project and the proposal shows that the company has not done the proper research to understand the impact on the region and the company is attempting to be misleading in their characterization of the project as closed loop.

The Catskills is a protected region, and the proposed sites within the project are located within the Catskills Forest Preserve (though the company falsely states the project will take place outside the protected boundaries - it won’t. This area is protected within the New York State Constitution, which deems these lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands and shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Any change would have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which would involve state legislative approval and a public referendum - this would almost certainly never be passed, so this project would be unlawful and unconstitutional.

As a fly fisher, snowboarder, and ice climber I’m also very concerned about what this project might do to the outdoor activities that the Catskills are known for. Pumped storage reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations in water, which would wreak havoc on surrounding wildlife habitats and alter the sediment regime in the Esopus which typically provides world class trout fishing. Route 214 is also one of the proposed sites for exploration, and re-routing this critical byway would be devastating. Route 214 provides access to skiing and snowboarding at Windham and Hunter Mountains, access to hiking trails across the area, and access to the best ice climbing routes in the Catskills. Modifying access to this road would mean limiting access to these critical outdoor pursuits and decreasing revenue from tourists engaging in these pursuits.

Finally, the company has either not done their proper due diligence or they are intentionally lying about characterizing their project as closed loop. This project is an open loop system, an add on project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source. The fact that they are attempting to distract and use the term “closed loop” to infer a smaller environmental impact is misleading and concerning - it shows they either do not know the land they wish to explore or worse, they do not care about the land they wish to explore and that will have horrible lasting effects for this region.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion><div class=card><div class=card-header id=headerPDF1><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapsePDF1 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapsePDF1>

I strongly oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy

I oppose it for the following reasons:

1.  The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest

      protection which explicitly bars development

3.  The project would severely impact traffic on New York State Route
      214, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and
      counties.

4.  Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required.

5.  The topography of the land would make rerouting or replacing New

888 First St. NE, Room 1A
Washington, D.C. 20426.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,
CJ Harvey</pre><hr><b>Comments of Denise Anderson under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Denise Anderson, New York, NY.

The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Emily Becker under P-15056.

I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Pumped Storage proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Mountains. I encourage FERC to decline this request for Project P-15056, because it would:

• Wreak havoc on a designated wildlife preserve under the protection of the New York Constitution

• Devastate the local communities as well as the tourism the Catskill mountains rely on economically

• Would harm the quality of the drinking water sourced from the Ashokan Reservoir which provides water to 40% of New York City&#39;s 9.7 million residents.



Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Re: Docket # P15056:000
Proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Hydro Plant

As a resident of Shandaken since 1998, and of NYC prior to that since 1952, I would like to vigorously object to the proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings to build a Pumped Storage facility that incorporates the Ashokan Reservoir. At the very least, this project in this place will cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in NYC. Additionally, pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. All proposed  reservoirs fall within a State Forest Preserve, considered Status 1 land by the US Geological Survey. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development”. 
Although this project is presented by Premium as Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower, this is not the case. This is an “add-on” project since it incorporates the existing Ashokan Reservoir. The danger to the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for the origin of the Ashokan can not be determined, and if negatively impacted may cause untold expenditures to correct.
As we move toward the goal of 70% renewable power by 2030, we must make sure we are selecting locations for pumped storage that will not create more environmental and economic damage than they attempt to alleviate.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing to urge you to decline Premium Energy Holdings’ request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 
Among other problems with this proposed project, it would further damage an economy and community that has been severely impacted by the New York City water supply system in its midst for over 100 years. The Ashokan Reservoir destroyed hundreds of homes, dozens of towns, and thousands of livelihoods when the it was built by eminent domain in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Ever since, the surrounding towns and their residents have been impacted daily by the existence of the reservoir, the vast tracts of land surrounding it that are not under local jurisdiction, and the vast areas beyond that that are governed by regulations of the City’s Watershed oversight agencies. 
Not only would such a plant impact our region, but it would have a negative impact on the New York City water supply, which the City has invested billions of dollars and countless oversight hours in protecting for over a century.

The Catskill Forest Preserve has been protected by the NY State Constitution since 1885. Designated Status One Land, the Dept. of Energy respects this land as requiring strict protection against development. Article XIV of the NYS Constitution specifically states that these forested lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild...&#34;. And that they &#34;shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; 

The Ashokan Pump Storage Project would be in violation of the NY State Constitution, increasing turbidity in NYC drinking water (approximately 1 billion gallons for 9.5 million persons daily), scarring the Ashokan Watershed area, disturbing wildlife habitats, displacing area residents for a second time, and disrupting the area’s tourism industry. 

As a pristine 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat, the forested area ranks among the top 1% of such habitats region-wide. The Catskill&#39;s own State Forest Preserve is considered Status One Land under the USGS &#34;Gap Analysis Program&#34;. Areas considered Status One, with formal protections under the Dept. of Energy &#34;Hydropower Vision&#34; are specified as to be avoided for development. 

This proposed Ashokan Pump Storage Project is an unacceptable project for the intended area. As this proposal has been earmarked by Premium of California to be a &#34;Closed-Loop&#34; system - which given the existence of the connected Esopus River it most certainly would not be, but rather an &#34;Add-on&#34; - their proposal should not even be considered.

I am strongly opposed to the proposed hydroelectric plant for reasons that include the following:

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Christopher Tyler under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Christopher Tyler, Shokan, NY.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in regard to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. This proposal is problematic and short-sighted, and I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The project, if completed, would negatively impact tourism, local communities, the area’s environment, and New York City’s drinking water.

One of the main problems is that the project will have a negative effect on tourism in the Catskills. In 2019, tourism generated 17% of the employment in the region; it is a $1.6 billion industry which supports thousands of jobs. The Catskill region is justly celebrated as a haven for hikers, fishermen, and skiers. Premium Energy’s project would cut off access to these and other forms of recreation. Furthermore, the project would irreparably damage the area’s natural beauty. With a decrease in tourism, businesses in Ulster County will suffer. 

Additionally, the project would be deeply damaging to the housing situation of local communities in the Catskills. Completion of the project would require the seizure of homes and private property via eminent domain, and displaced residents will have a difficult time finding affordable housing in the area. Ulster County is experiencing a severe housing shortage and the properties that are available are extremely expensive. Furthermore, many in the area are already struggling with loss of income due to the pandemic.

Premium Energy’s project will also cause egregious harm to the environment. Large areas of wildlife habitat are rare in our country: the Catskill Forest Preserve comprises almost 700,000 acres of contiguous habitat, and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats in the region, per the New York State Forest Condition Index. In addition, Catskill Forest Preserve lands, under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, are clearly designated as “forever. . .  wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

Finally, Premium Energy’s project is a serious threat to New York City’s drinking water. The project would make use of the already-existing Ashokan Reservoir, which serves the city and which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, providing 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. In the 1990s alone, $1.7 billion was invested in the reservoir. It would be foolish to endanger this essential resource in the ways that Premium Energy’s project proposes. Their proposed pumped storage plant would adversely affect the sediment regime in tributary rivers and streams that feed the reservoir—ultimately harming not only the fish and wildlife that depend on them but also the millions of  New York City residents who do as well.

I am in favor of renewable energy, and that I hope it will play a large part in our transition away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable sources. However, we cannot sacrifice community and environmental well-being in pursuit of this goal. Though Premium Energy claims their project is a “closed loop,” a type of pumped storage project that would have a smaller impact on the surrounding ecosystem, this is false: the project is in fact an “add on” since it would use an existing body of water, the Ashokan, as a lower reservoir. In putting the project forward as a “closed loop,” Premium Energy has already lied to us. How can we trust them to maintain high standards and care for the community if they have based their proposal on a falsehood?

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I am a full-time resident of the Catskills. I am also a hiker and birder who enjoys the Catskills on a daily basis. I write to strongly oppose this ill-considered and damaging project.

The proposal is located within the Catskill Park, a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The park consists of over 600,000 acres of forest and wilderness land within easy driving distance of millions of residents in metropolitan New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Visitors come to enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, hunting and nature study They also come to experience solitude, quiet contemplation and rejuvenation. 
 
The proposed reservoirs are especially troubling. They will permanently prevent hiker access to mountains in the Burroughs Range, disrupt traffic on the only route north-south highway through the region, and prevent access to campgrounds and trout streams.  Loos of access to one area would result in overuse in others, and the pandemic has already caused a tectonic shift in use levels. This would directly impact hundreds of thousands of visitors and cause significant economic hardship to many small tourism-based businesses. This would harm the may small communities that make up the region.

Sensitive ecosystems would be disrupted by the requisite utility infrastructure required by a development of this scale.  Even the reservoirs themselves would have little ecological benefit since the water levels constantly change.

In summary, this is not the right place for this proposal, and I urge you to deny the permit.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marjory Widensky under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marjory Widensky, Phoenicia, NY.
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project
P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and homes for which we live in and businesses we own, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process.
Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which
supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.
In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium
Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable
upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes
and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands
when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the
Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing,
as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.
As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage
Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of
innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage
projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing
watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium
is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their
project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir.
This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower
reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being
fast-tracked for approval? Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost
of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to
find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the
construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable
communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit

Dear Ms. Bose,

 

I am writing to urge you and your team at FERC to decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it is incredibly flawed and would be devastating to the place my family calls home. Allowing this proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains would mean destroying an ecosystem, disrupting local communities, and risking the purity of NYC’s drinking water. This idea is not worth the negative long-term cost.

 

Here’s a bulleted list as to why this idea is flawed:

 

·        Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife and ecosystem are at risk of being tampered with. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. It would be a complete shame to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

·        Pumped storage wreaks havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. Our home is part of the Ashokan watershed and I know how delicate the ecosystem is. Without a doubt of the rough water continuously moving up and doing that it would impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.

·        The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

·        Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, which we are a part of. This project would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced.

·        The proposed project would effect the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs.

·        The project would impair the connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

 

I could outline many more reasons, but the major points are that this project will directly hurt the environment, local community and even tourism. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

Dear Ms. Bose,

Article XIV of the NYS Constitution clearly states that the lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

This letter should begin and end with this simple, clear and binding promise. And yet the value of a promise is really only determined during periods of temptation, and this is one of those times we need to hold fast in the face of pressure from those who offer jobs and energy in exchange for the right to break this contract.

Without a doubt, we must look for sources of sustainable energy. But why must that come at the cost of one of the few pristine ecosystems left in the country? Why displace people, disrupt waterways, threaten NYC drinking water, decimate thriving species and test the entire local ecosystem in order to take a single step forward renewable energy? Why spoil the very thing we are trying to preserve?

More than 120 years ago, some wise people decided that it was in our collective best interest to protect the forests and waterways of the Catskills. They proclaimed that these lands should remain &#34;forever wild,&#34; a haven that would be unsullied by the stresses and pollutions of industry. Until now, that promise has been kept. Help ensure it remains so.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

As a resident of Woodland Valley, I would like to make my strong opposition to the proposed hydro electric reservoir project known.  This is a historic, bucolic valley with sensitive wildlife, and an important tourism industry to the area and community. I have been in Woodland Valley and the Hamlet of Phoenicia for over 20 years. I have seen derelict buildings, plazas and struggling businesses, turn around and finally start to thrive and employe local residences. This has brought much needed income to the region and the Mom and Pop small businesses.  Along with these flourishing and successful businesses, there are Historic Inns, campgrounds and world renowned trout fishing that would all be devastated if not permanently destroyed.

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Maxine Davidowitz under P-15056.

I want to strenuously object to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Please decline their request...it would be devastating to the environment and will not provide the net positive clean energy we need. As well, it will be disastrous to tourism, to the natural environment, and be highly disruptive to local communities. Not to mention risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water as well as local wells.
Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that the lands that are earmarked for destruction “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land and would set a terrible precedent for protected lands across the country. The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a traumatic event that happened here over 100 years ago, and the region still bears the scars. Residents displaced would likely have a hard time finding new homes in the area, given our current housing shortage in Ulster County. The Catskill region is also a $1.6 billion tourism industry, generating 17% of the employment  in 2019, and supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir. It supplies 40% of NYC’s water, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal mis-identifies it as a closed-loop system—it is in fact an “add-on,” which is not recommended by your agency. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. The water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed—the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation that represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, so that they can go back to the drawing board and find an alternative location — one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, threaten the water supply of the nation&#39;s largest city, and wreak havoc on incredibly important natural resources.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Anne Bloomfield under P-15056.

Re: Project P-15056 Ashokan Pumped Storage 

Dear Secretary Bose:

I am an Ecologist at the manager level for a local non-profit along the Esopus Creek in Hurley, NY. In addition, I hunt, hike and fish in the Catskills and own property in the Town of Olive. Finally, I will include that, as a supporter of renewable energy, I own solar panels in a local community solar array on property owned by a local church. All of these credentials have allowed me to examine the request for preliminary work for the pumped storage project by Premium Energy Holdings, LLC in a holistic manner.  As an Ecologist, I tend to review such cases as scientifically and objectively as possible. I have concluded that this is not merely a “not in my backyard” situation. Renewable energy production and storage is important infrastructure to consider. But it must be “the right project in the right place”. Based on the evidence I have in front of me, this project is not a good for fit the geographic area. I have outlined the reasons below. 

1.	State Constitution ARTICLE XIV- CONSERVATION This project is not compatible with the states desire to protect and preserve forests and wildlife.  Article XIV in the New York State constitution states, “ Forest preserve to be forever kept wild; authorized uses and exceptions] Section 1. The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private… forest and wildlife conservation are hereby declared to be policies of the state”. Honor the State’s constitution as it pertains to biodiversity conservation, clean air and water when evaluating such projects
2.	Ecological Services and the “Public Benefit” The potential benefits of the project are minimal to the “public good” compared to the value of these lands for conservation of biodiversity as well as the ecological services provided to the People of the Unites States by such lands. The benefits of unfragmented, protected forest preserve land to the people of the United States are many but to name a few: mitigation of extreme weather events, pollination and pest control services, clean water and clean air. The potential benefits of this project do not outweigh the loss or reduction of these services. Considering a project such as this within the “Blue Line” of the Catskill Forest Preserve is irresponsible and sets a dangerous precedent. A project such as this should not even be considered on protected public lands state, federal or otherwise due to their value to the public benefit as well as to biodiversity conservation. Recognize the public benefit of services provided by protected public land
3.	Premium energy proposal is not the type of project encouraged by DOE The project is not closed loop as proposed due to the fact that the Esopus Creek runs into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir. The DOE has promoted closed loop projects, which this project is not, despite its proposal as such. An April 2020 Department of Energy report (Hydrowires) concluded that “the environmental effects of closed-loop projects are generally lower (i.e., more localized and of shorter duration) than those of open-loop projects because they: (1) are located “off-stream,” potentially minimizing aquatic and terrestrial impacts, and; (2) often have greater siting flexibility than open-loop projects. In particular, the impacts to aquatic resources are typically lower for closed-loop projects than for open-loop, as closed-loop projects are not continuously connected to any naturally-flowing body of water. This avoids the movement of water between reservoir and free-flowing water that drives many impacts of open-loop projects. For closed-loop projects, the impacts on aquatic resources are primarily related to the initial withdrawal of surface water for reservoir fill, which could reduce the availability of surface water for other uses.”  Deny  projects that are not in line with the type of projects the DOE is encouraging 
4.	Impacts to forest preserve ecology As stated previously, such lands not only provide valuable services to the People of the United States, they also provide immense value in terms of biodiversity conservation. The biodiversity crisis is a global crisis. Unfragmented protected lands such as the Catskill Forest Preserve are critical to reversing the rapid and alarming loss of biodiversity globally. Siting a project such as this within the Catskill Forest Preserve would be unforgivable from a biodiversity conservation prospective. Help solve, not worsen the biodiversity crisis, respect and protect our forest preserve lands.
5.	The Filtration Avoidance Determination The FAD as it relates to the NYC watershed and water supply would need to be renegotiated with the USEPA before preliminary work on this project could proceed. Protect the NYC watershed and drinking water supply for nearly 9 million Americans

To conclude my examination of this project proposal, I respectfully request that FERC deny approval at this stage. 

Sincerely,

Re: Project P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose,

  We are writing in opposition to the project proposed by Premium Energy for the Catskill Park region. 

   The permit application filed by Premium Energy should be rejected for it’s large number of mistakes, falsehoods and omissions. The first and most glaring falsehood is that the Premium Energy project is not a closed loop project. The Ashokan reservoir, which is proposed as the lower reservoir, is an open body of water that ultimately flows through the Lower Esopus and into the Hudson River. So the “closed-loop” system claim is false.  An open loop system will have a greater amount of potential impacts all the way down the line. And, in any project that uses this body of water, the residents of the downstream towns should be identified and notified before any permit is approved. 

   The preliminary maps for the upper reservoirs show that two are, in whole or in part, within the boundries of the Town of Shandaken. The town should have been named as an interested party as should all the towns of 5000&#43; residents within fifteen miles of Shandaken. Not all of these towns have been identified or notified.

  And, while we understand the maps are preliminary, and Ulster County has already been named within the application, the map of the Stony Clove site on Rt 214 clearly shows the project crossing into the next county and town, neither of which has been named as an interested party on this application.

  The following statement from the permit application is wholly incorrect.  “The proposed upper reservoir alternatives: Stony Clove Reservoir, Woodland Reservoir or Wittenberg Reservoir, would be created in the New York’s State lands.” It seems that the maps of the area have been egregiously misread. The park was created many, many years after the lands within its boundaries were bought and settled by individuals. So, while still being in the confines of the Catskill Park, most of the land proposed for the upper reservoirs is privately owned. In Woodland Valley alone 75 to 100 homes would be flooded to make way for the “upper reservoir”. As well as another 100&#43; homes , ours included, would lose the use of Woodland Valley Road, which is their only access to their property. None of the home/property owners of the Woodland Valley properties or the other two upper reservoir sites have been identified or notified. 

  Also, flooding Woodland Valley would cut off access to the Woodland Valley Campground. This campground is a NY State owned facility (one of the state’s oldest) that, according to the DEC’s most recent Unit Management Plan, 1994, has 70 campsites and is used by over 5400 campers and at least 2600 day use visitors annually.  There is also a second privately owned campground in Woodland Valley,  that also serves the many tourists who come to visit this area and contributes to the tourist economy of the area. This facility was also not named in the permit application but would be flooded if the current maps are followed and as such should have been identified and notified. 

   The majority of the NY State lands that are proposed for use within this application are part of the Catskill Park “forever wild” designated lands. This historic designation was intended to preserve these forests for the protection and enjoyment of the residents and our visitors. These protections were legislated by and for the people of New York State and would require a New York State constitutional amendment to change. No mention of this fact was made in the application.

     For these reasons as well as others we feel this application is poorly executed and deficient and as such should be rejected. And while we understand the need for hydro-electric energy in our future renewable energy mix we want to make clear that we feel this project comes at too high of a cost to our state and our community. 

  Sincerely,
Carol Seitz and Harry Jameson</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jeff Notti under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jeff Notti, Mount Tremper, NY.
The Catskill park was established in 1885 and protected by the New York State Constitution  which declares the park  “shall be forever  kept as wild forest lands [and] shall not be leased, sold or exchanged , to be taken by any corporation public or private”. 

The proposal of a 300 foot deep hydroelectric plant and a 200 foot dam, will devastate the highly preserved and protected land.  It would negatively impact the stream ecology of the Ashokan watershed. This will directly threaten NYC’s water supply.  

The upheaval and destruction of the Ashokan Reservoir is a disastrous plan.  The damage to the watershed arises from the construction of the dam and the pipe line to underground plant.  This will severely damage the trout spawning tributaries of the Esopus. Not to mention the tearing up the sides of two mountains is never a good idea.  

The alternative location is an even worse disaster.  Route 214 going up the Stony Clove to hunter is extremely narrow, with stunning views of the mountains with incredible hiking through out. 

Moon Haw Road, and Chichester communities may be removed by eminent domain, this is not a pretty picture.  The Sundown Wild Forest could be impacted as well as the communities along the Dry Brook (creek). The water way between Phoenicia and Chichester along the Stony Clove is stunningly beautiful as it the dive to Peekmoose  passed Moon Haw Road.  The level of construction necessary could potentially be a disaster for the Catskill Preserve.  Heavy construction along 214 could demand a revamping of the entire road way in order to accommodate heavy construction.  There would be effects on the Hunter West Kill Wilderness and the Indian Head Wilderness.  The cement production alone for the related constructions produces more pollutants than will be saved by the “clean” power form the electric plant.  

Clearly the Sturgeon Pond Hydro plant can be upgraded refitted with modern turbines with far less impact and less cost, similarly the way the Niagara turbines were revamped.    

Do you really want to be seen as a representative that condoned the destruction of this beautiful environment?</pre><hr><b>Comments of Glennon Beresin under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Glennon Beresin, Medford, MA.
Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Finally, it must be highlighted that Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposal does not represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
I am part of the Catskills community that would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

A site where the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook, Werner/stoney clove creek and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time,

As an ardent Catskills hiker and fisherman, I am writing in opposition to the proposed pumped-storage hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve. This project will have negative impacts on both the Ashokan Reservoir and its surrounding area. The proposal directly threatens the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, the quality of the New York City water supply, and the economy of the region.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the New York State Constitution. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

The Catskills are a major hiking destination that draws people from all over the Northeast. 
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and the trail user experience on multiple hiking trails in areas designated as Wilderness. 

The road closures caused by the proposed pumped storage project will eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that have happened over the past 12 months due to the unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems fragmenting habitat, cause the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of facilities, as was cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna, which are synonymous with the Forest Preserve, would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs. The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Also, all proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area. See https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area 

Additionally, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact New York City’s drinking water. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the New York City water supply. Valuable trout breeding habitat would be lost. It would also affect fishing, boating, and swimming, all critical draws for a region dependent on tourism.

Rerouting Route 214, a Scenic Byway, would be incredibly disruptive. It is a major transportation artery for the Catskills, one of few roads that connect the central and northern regions. The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue caused by this construction project would directly hurt the local communities. It would significantly impact access to skiing at Hunter Mountain and summer concerts in Phoenicia, Hunter, and Tannersville.

I understand that sometimes sacrifices need to be made for our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources, but I do not believe it should come at the cost of environmental and economic devastation. Please reject the Premium Energy proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

Dear Ms. Bose,

Protected lands impact our communities in profound ways. Catskill park not only provides safe drinking water for New York City, but contains an ecosystem that is home to hundreds of important animal and plant species. I spent every summer of my childhood visiting Catskill Park, and the experiences I had were instrumental in shaping my understanding and appreciation of the natural world and of my role in helping to protect our planet. These protected lands, which are disappearing rapidly, are priceless.

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Hi folks,
As a Town of Olive resident, I am opposed to the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. 

My family has been through something like this before. It was my great grandpa, Henry Clay Elmendorf, who had his land taken by the original Ashokan Reservoir project, and he was paid pennies on the dollar. 

In the current proposal, it includes &#34;taking&#34; people&#39;s land. 

Another objection has to do with conservation of energy. You propose pumping massive amounts of water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation, then later releasing that water, running it though a generator so you can make energy.

Does that really make good energy sense? Seems it would be much better to devise a method whereby you could have continues power generation capability. Something more must be at stake here. I am fully aware of the problem of renewables and that they are unreliable. In fact I have deployed solar at my home. 

Why try to put a band aid on an idea, use energy inefficiently, and displace 
people from their homes, to pursue an unstated goal of renewable energy. 

This Ashokan Pumped Storage Project is a BAD idea, and as a resident in the area, I am strongly opposed.  

Respectfully yours,
Dan Elmendorf</pre><hr><b>Comments of Dan Segal under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dan Segal, MAPLEWOOD, NJ.
The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The plan as proposed would have very negative impacts on the NYC&#39;s drinking water.
Also, other negative impacts are on the ecology of the Preserve, on the streams, on fishing, and boating and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 would be extremely disruptive.
There would be a loss of tourist dollars.
It is vitally important to future generations to preserve the State Preserve.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jennifer E Rossa under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jennifer E Rossa, Beacon, NY.

I am one of many people who currently enjoy hiking in this protected area, and I believe it is vital for the economic health and environmental sustainability of the region that this project not go forward in this region.

I understand the need for new hydroelectric projects, but protected forests, streams and wildlife should not be sacrificed in the process.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. My wife&#39;s family has owned property in Halcott Center since 1959; she and her siblings and our children have grown up cherishing the beauty of the Catskills, and in fact have an easement agreement with the NYC DEP to prevent overdevelopment and further damage to the environment.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in regard to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, the negative impact on the local environment -  ecological, economic and at a grassroots community level - simply vastly outweigh the benefits. 

I’m a huge advocate for green power, but believe the correct green solutions should be to the benefit of all - local and national - not at the cost of stunning wildlife, already hard hit communities and in this case threaten to disrupt the water supply of millions. 

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The precedent for protected lands across the country here is a terrible example - NY should lead in the protection of our country, not follow the reckless, destructive example set by the country’s leadership in the last four years. 

The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. 

Also of extreme concern is the economic impact - in a year when many have lost jobs, had earnings vastly reduced (as a small biz owner it has been brutal and the lack of support deeply depressing) putting further strain on the community is unacceptable. How can anyone justify the one bright light of recent years - growing tourism and investment.   

It also appears from my research that this project does not represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see.  How can we trust a company that would mislead in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Re: Motion to Oppose Project #15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

Dear Ms. Bose: 

I am writing to express my opposition to Project #15056-000, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  My family has lived and owned property in the Woodland Valley for nearly 200 years.  We have enjoyed summers, winters, and all seasons in between in this beautiful valley.  This dam has many negative impacts on this unique and wonderful ecosystem, including but not limited to: unacceptable risks to NYC DEP&#39;s unfiltered drinking water caused by increased turbidity and sediment to the Ashokan Reservoir which meaningfully impact New York City’s water supply; unacceptable impacts to communities working to protect NYC DEP&#39;s water supply; negative impacts on the Catskills tourism economy; negative impacts to Esopus Creek&#39;s valuable recreational fishery; the loss of the Woodland Valley Stream and its recreational fishery; the carbon loss of the forest and soil of more than 200 acres for the reservoir and associated roads, dam and other infrastructure; and irreversible impacts to wildlife in the project zone.  

Our family, as well as all of those living in the valley, would be impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually, from the proposed project #15056.  

I urge FERC to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms.Bose,

I am writing in reference and opposition to the proposed Hydroelectric pumping station project with Premium Energy Holdings for the Ashokan Reservoir area in upstate NY. I strongly urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The environmental and community-wide disruptive extent of this project would be immense.

Two points that stand out to me.   

The Catskill Forest Preserve is protected by our NY State Constitution Article XIV, for important reasons. Wildlife and plantlife need vast swaths of land to be successful and this preserve is 700,000 continuous acres of land. This is an increasingly rare occurrence in our modern world. Continuous preserved land is essential to biological success and necessary to our overall survival on the planet. The Constitution clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

The second point is the almost complete disruption and displacement of entire communities that are the fabric of our economy, our character, our tourism and our history. People have visited the Catskills for decades because of the rural, historic beauty and charm of our local communities. This must be considered.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources. I would also hope that our government would begin to really introduce the practice of conservation of resources as a collective and viable way to generate less and less energy so that storage that can devastate large, protected areas, is not the first option we seek.

Thank you for your consideration,

The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. K. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

Though new hydroelectric projects may be key in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process as this is highly preserved land that must be protected:
-	The Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County 
-	Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
-	The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 
-	All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area 
-	As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
-	According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum

This would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect.

Premium Energy must not be allowed to build a dam, reservoir, and power plant in the Catskill Forrest Preserve. While I understand the need for clean renewable power I believe that this project would do more harm than good. The watershed has significant historic and cultural value as one of the most important trout streams in the world. There is a significant wild rainbow trout run in the Esopus and the brown trout population in the upper Ashokan basin uses the Esopus as a spawning run as well.
The proposed 226-acre reservoir and associated 300&#43; foot tall dam would cause tremendous habitat destruction and alter the local wild scenery in one of the most celebrated outdoor regions of the State.
What makes the project such a bad fit for the area is the large flow fluctuations it will cause n the Ashokan reservoir and the proposed reservoir. They fact that the water levels will be rising and lowering rapidly and at ecologically random intervals will cause harm to the aquatic wildlife as well as the forrest wildlife attracted to the shorelines.
Imagine looking down on a 20’ wide, mud-bank rimmed reservoir from Slide Mountain. This would be enough to cause John Burroughs to roll in his grave.
Please, lets stop this terrible idea before it wastes any more time.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marilynn Taylor under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marilynn Taylor, Williston Park, NY.

Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,
I would like to register my objection to the proposed construction of a dam on the Ashokan Reservoir.

I am a lifelong resident of NYS and my family and I have vacationed in the area of Woodland Valley since 1976. We enjoy the nature activities of hiking and swimming and pristine nature of the surroundings. My husband does fly fishing for trout in the Woodland Valley stream, and as I state below it is a critical habitat for many animals.

Following are my objections to this project:

• Environment and Water Supply:
The project site is inside of Catskill Forest Preserve, and would destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology, the Esopus is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding habitats, and the area is one of the premier birding areas of NY State. This project would muddy the waters in the Ashokan Reservoir, which by the way supplies NYC with a high percentage of drinking water.

• Tourism and Small Businesses:
I have witnessed the growth of tourism in this area over the years and many small businesses have prospered. This will be devastating to them. Many local people would be put out of work, thus it is a another negative impactment.

• Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that
already displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.

The Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County and I believe under the Constitution of New York it is protected and not to be sold or leased or exchanged by any corporation public or private corporations.

I urge you, as a responsible public official, to reject the Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Marilynn Taylor</pre><hr><b>Comments of Louis Mellet under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Louis Mellet, Armonk, NY.
I agree with all of the reasons below why this project should not move forward:

• Impacts on highly preserved land
o A Highly Preserved Land
▪ The Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County
▪ Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild
forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any
corporation, public or private.”
▪ The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly
fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the
top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest
Condition Index.
▪ All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area:
see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area
▪ As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land
under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own
Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2
under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
▪ According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management
in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment,
voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to
the public in a referendum
• Impacts on Stream Ecology
▪ Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water
which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats 
▪ Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment
regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the
NYC water supply
▪ Valuable trout breeding habitat would be lost
• Impacts to NYC water supply
o According to the DEP-Provides 40% of NYC’s water, a water supply that provides 1 billion
gallons a day to 9.5 million people
o The largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, built at the cost of displacing 25
communities
o A NYC valuable capital asset, representing billions of dollars of investment; $1.7 billion
since the 1990s alone
o Meets current NYC needs, but climate change produces uncertainty about its future
ability to do so: evaporation, heat events, and decreasing snowpack.
• Impacts on Catskills tourism economy
o Tourism is an integral part of the NYS economy and continues to grow
o Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019
o A $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs
o Ulster County represents 43% of that market
o Second homes generate $360 million in economic activity
▪ Source: Tourism Economics, “Economic Impact of Tourism in NY, 2019”
• This is not the innovation that Department of Energy would want
o Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus
eligible for streamlined FERC approval; that’s why Premium is claiming to be “closedloop.”
o • Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as
“add-on” projects; that’s what this really is. They are lying.
o • “Initial construction impacts” for these projects are lower, but “operational impacts are
still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the addon project’s lower
reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water
feature that was dammed for its original construction.”

To Whom it May Concern,
I am a resident of Chichester, NY (Ulster County) and am writing to oppose granting a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings, it is misleading and deficient.

There is definitely a need to reduce our need for fossil fuels and become more reliant on renewable energy.  The Catskill area is not the place for a project like this without irreversibly damaging the state preserved forest land, wildlife and waterways. 

Premium Energy Holding&#39;s proposal is misleading and deficient.  The project is located in the heart of Catskills Forest Preserve when the proposal says it is not...This is  700,000 acres of land protected by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution.  The Article states these lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold and exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.  To change the above would require a constitutional amendment that is voted on twice by the New York State Legislature and submitted to the public in a referendum.

In a hydropower project such as what is being proposed , the fluctuations of pumped water would increase the turbidity of the New York City water supply.  The Catskills provide 40% of New York Cities drinking water.  This project would wreak havoc on land and water wildlife and their habitat.  

The Catskills Forest Preserve is essential to many protected, rare and threatened species such as:

Northern long-eared bat, black throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, wood thrush, cooper hawk, red-shouldered hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, Eastern hognose snake and timber rattlesnake, northern cricket frog.  Trout&#39;s ability to spawn would be destroyed.

Also misleading in Premium Energy Holding proposal is describing it as a closed-loop system when it is clearly an open-loop design. This will have major impact on the free-flowing Stony Clove Creek.  My family has lived on the Stony Clove creek Since 1927.  This area has received funding from the NYC DEP Stream Management Program, the US Army Corps of Engineers under the Watershed Environmental Assistance Program and New York State DEC.  The effort and money put into these projects has greatly improved the quality of water, the health of the creek and the turbidity that had been plaguing the waterway

To Whom it May Concern, 
I am a resident of Chichester, NY (Ulster County).  I strongly oppose the granting of a Preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings, it is misleading and deficient.
I believe the Catskills Forest Preserve is not the right location of such a project given the significant impacts to the forest lands, streams and wildlife and the New York City water supply.  This proposal would be in violation of the New York State Constitution Article XIV.  The Article states these lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any management of the State Forest Preserve.  A constitutional amendment is required, one that is voted on twice by the NYS legislature and submitted to the public in a referendum.
Premium Energy claims it will build a closed loop system and this is false. when it is actually an open loop system, where an upper reservoir would be added an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source.  The environmental impact to aquatic and wildlife would be significant. 
As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program.  According the US Department of Energy&#39;s own Hydropower Vision report,  Areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development. 
 Given the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve, the misleading nature of Premium Energy&#39;s proposal and the US Department of Energy&#39;s Hydropower Vision report to avoid Status 1 land, are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.
Sincerely,

This proposed project is NOT good for the Catskills.  It is truly an assault on the intended purpose of Catskill Park, which was set aside to remain a forever wild tract of land.  If a hydroelectric plant is needed in the Catskills, it should be built outside of designated preserves.  Otherwise, what is the point of calling something a preserve??  What are we &#39;preserving&#39; if we allow such a project to proceed, knowing it threatens the ecology of the park, the recreational access to trails, and the drinking water supply of NYC?  Let me repeat that last part.  This project threatens the drinking water of millions upon millions of people living in our country&#39;s most populous city.  Permission for this project needs to be denied.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Meghan Taylor under P-15056.

I am writing to urge you to reject the proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains. I write as a lifelong visitor to the area - to see the destruction of this key resource in New York is devastating.  This project is deeply flawed on a number of fronts: It is extremely invasive to the community that resides there and will impact not just their environment but the thriving tourism that currently exists there. Even more critical is habitat destruction for the local wildlife, flora, and fauna. Finally, this project will have a lasting negative impact on the reservoir that is New York’s drinking water supply.  Technically I urge that the project must be rejected because:
 
1. The proposed site is on designated Status 1 land, and federal policy explicitly directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development. This proposal would demand a Constitutional Amendment passed by the NYS Legislature and signed by the Governor. This barrier alone is sufficient to stop the proposal, in its tracks, at this very moment.
 
2.The proposed project will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for 9 million New York residents.
 
3. The flawed application misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.
 
4.The project raises numerous legal issues regarding States’ rights and land reservation.
 
5. The proposed site is home to protected species of wildlife and flora/fauna, as well as historical and cultural artifacts and sites.

Additionally, comments from Premium Energy&#39;s Leadership demonstrate that the Company itself has seriously erred in their proposal development by presenting a plan that even they admit is faulty:

 &#34;The Ashokan project will be built only with the cooperation of the community. We don’t want to harm or damage nothing or no one. It looks like the first choice of upper reservoir was a bad choice. There is a community in that location. This site alternative therefore will not be any longer pursue it.&#34;
 
&#34;Also, since this reservoir belongs to the city of New York, if the city of New York deems this project not safe for the integrity of the water supply to the City, this project will not happen.&#34;

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, negatively impact the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers.

I am writing to object to the flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to reject Premium&#39;s application for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The application is facially defective and the proposed project would devastate the environment, the local communities, and would risk the purity of NYC’s drinking water.  Pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects may play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, but the constitutionally protected Catskill Forest Preserve is not the right place for one. 

	1) Article XIV of the NYS Constitution guarantees that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Changes. if any, to the status of this land would require a constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions of the state legistalure and then subnmitted to a public vote by referendum.

	2)  Contrary to the description in Premium&#39;s application, this is not a closed-loop project, which is the kind of project the Department of Energy wants to see due to its lower environmental impacts.  It is an add-on project, using an existing body of water as the lower reservoir.  Add-on projects have significantly higher risks.  The Esopus Creek and other streams flow into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir (which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people). The  proposed project would therefore directly interact with an unfiltered public water source. Since the Catskills are within a State Forest Preserve, they are designated Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. The Department of Energy&#39;s own materials on hydropower state a clear preference for closed-loop and not add-on projects and indicate that development of Status 1 or 2 lands should be avoided.  

	3)  Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters.  Water level fluctuations would also increase turbidity within the Reservoir itself.  NYC is not presently required to filter the Ashokan water pursuant to long-standing EPA consent to the New York City Filtration Avoidance Program (FAD).  EPA&#39;s consent was just renewed in December 2017.  If Premium&#39;s application were to be granted, this would potentially create a conflict between the positions taken by two federal agencies.

	4)  Ulster County should not have been the only county notified of Premium&#39;s proposal.  Thw proposed Stony Clove Reservoir actually falls within the Town of Hunter in Greene County.  Upon information and belief, Greene County was never notifed of Premium&#39;s application, rendering it defective on its face.

	5) In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, requiring the seizing of private property by eminent domain in any of the locations proposed by Premium. Displaced residents would have difficulty securing new, affordable housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County.  There would also be a negative effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Because of the proposal’s numerous deficiencies, I am asking FERC to decline their request even for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as in my opinion, it is flawed from a legal, procedural, technical and moral perspective.

Legally and procedurally/practically, the proposal is ill-advised:
 
•	NYS Constitution’s Article XIV provides that the Catskill Forest Preserve, created in 1885, “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
•	As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are also considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”  
•	According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. 

Next, based upon my research, I do not believe this company’s project description is even technically accurate. No doubt aware that the Department of Energy views “closed loop” pumped storage projects favorably, given their smaller environmental impacts, Premium Energy mischaracterizing their project as such when in fact it is actually an “add-on” project due to its use of an existing watershed as a lower reservoir.
 
While initial construction impacts for these projects may seem lower, they will ultimately be higher (than for a true closed loop project) because the add-on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to the natural flowing water feature that was damned for its initial construction. Such add-on projects are risky and disruptive enough, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city, New York City, as the Ashokan Reservoir in this case is, and which this project will directly jeopardize. 

How can we trust the quality¬¬--and ongoing attention and care that will be required—of a project that is, at best, this arguably sloppy and inexact from the get-go? Please do not reward this company by granting them the streamlined FERC approval they are trying to gain with what in my opinion is a mischaracterization of this project’s essential and technical nature.

Finally, from a moral perspective Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply and disproportionately damaging to local communities. (And dismissing this point as a mere “NIMBY” argument would be as inaccurate as the characterization of this as a “closed loop” system.)
 
Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the eminent domain seizure of homes and private property that already saw thousands of such seizures (including the flooding of entire valleys; the loss of entire towns; the taking of homes, churches, schools and graveyards of extended and multigenerational families) when the Ashokan itself was constructed, only a few generations ago. 

To the NIMBY point, I would ask you to consider, exactly how many “backyards” must one community be asked and expected to surrender? 

History aside, residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would face real difficulties securing new housing, as there is currently a severe shortage of affordable housing in Ulster County, which has only been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. And, even if they could find alternate housing, this project’s devastating impact on the local tourism and outdoor recreation economy—which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs—would threaten their ability to afford these new homes. This ripple effect would in turn negatively affect businesses in Ulster County, and well beyond. These effects are unjustifiably disproportionate.

In sum, our country’s critical transition to renewable, green-energy sources demands that we proceed responsibly, and with accuracy, fairness, due process and proper proportion. If that transition is undertaken and implemented crudely and incorrectly—and in name only—we will defeat its very purpose and cause significantly more harm than good. 

I thank you for the important role you play in this process and urge you to deny this proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Thanks for offering the opportunity to register my concern about this project. As a homeowner, business owner, mother and neighbor in West Shokan, NY I know we can do better than this flawed proposal puts forward. This Premium Energy plan would ruin my house and my business which are on the banks of the Bushkill River. We run the only cafe and market (Marty’s ‘Mercantile) serving our hamlet. This plan is bad for tourism (we were just written up in Hudson Valley Magazine!) 

Ulster county makes up 43% of NY state’s tourism income and the adverse impact of this project would greatly diminish the stream ecology which would also kill the trout and limit fly fishing tourists. My personal home, my three kids’ welfare and our community are also on my mind. 

Please consider the pump in a location near the aero rater where less personal and professional harm could be done to our community.

Dear Ms. Bose,

Premium Energy Holdings has proposed to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as this add-on (NOT closed loop) system would be devastating to the environment.

The Catskill Forest Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

And the destruction would not simply stop when construction on this project did. Premium says this is a “closed loop” system but the project’s lower reservoir would remain continuously connected to the natural flowing water feature that was damned for its initial construction. Pumped storage will disrupt nearby stream ecology and both aquatic and land habitats as the pumping causes rapid water and unnatural and violent fluctuations. This in turn would affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters. There is nothing “closed” about it. 

The Esopus is also of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. It would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources is an undeniable and very important goal, and I certain recognize the scope of the task you have before you. However, I hope you will agree that it makes no sense to approve projects, such as this one, which will decimate and destroy the very environment they are purporting to protect. 

I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I am a frequent visitor to and renter in West Shokan, a hamlet in the town of Olive, New York. 

West Shokan, as well as the very road I live on, Moonhaw Road, is one of the towns being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a 300-foot dam, giant reservoir, turbine, and 50-foot tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. There will also be unsightly transmission towers up and down many roads, the mountain and valleys, and along the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies drinking water 40% of water to New York City. A power plant would be built right next to the Ashokan reservoir. 

I reject this proposal, object to this proposal and downright am horrified by this proposal, which would negatively impact the environment, destroy communities, upend the homes of many wild creatures great and small. The construction would permanently damage the rivers and streams, and the power plant would disrupt the flow to and increase the turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir, destroy mountains, as well as the quiet beauty of the Catskills, where people have been coming for centuries for respite.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,
Regarding the deeply flawed proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains, I am writing to urge FERC to decline Premium Energy Holdings’ request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The project would be devastating to the environment, disruptive to local communities, and dangerous for NYC’s drinking water.
The crucially protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Additionally, all proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area, habitat for NY-species of Greatest Conservation Need including the black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager and wood thrush. The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment). Furthermore, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program,” and according to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
Even once construction were to be completed, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.
Disturbingly, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I’m writing to oppose Premium Energy Holdings’ flawed proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains and to urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The project would be a disaster for our environment, traumatic to local communities, a threat to NYC’s drinking water.
In the necessary move to sustainable energies, the protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed.

Re: FERC P-15056-000

To Whom It May Concern,

As the New York State Assemblymember representing the 66th district in Manhattan, I am writing to vehemently oppose the application by Premium Energy Holdings LLC for a preliminary permit to explore building an underground hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir (docket P-15056-000). 

The Ashokan Reservoir, located in Ulster County, is a critical water source for New York City, and provides over 40 percent of the city’s drinking water. Premium’s proposal would create a large and intricate new underground power plant, with construction including the creation of a new reservoir, new tunnels to pump water to and from the existing reservoir, and generators to capture energy created by the flow of water between the two reservoirs.

The proposal is concerning for a number of reasons. Most importantly, it was undertaken without any consultation with New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or with the local municipalities surrounding the Ashokan Reservoir. The DEP and local governments were only notified of the proposal following your agency’s release of a notice of application in February, and have raised significant concerns. Premium, the applicant, is based in California and local authorities have pointed to a lack of knowledge of the Ashokan and surrounding areas, ranging from basic errors in their mapping to the proposed placements of the new upper reservoir, which in one case would require the flooding of an entire residential community (Woodland Valley). The proposed new reservoir sites also appear to fall within State lands that have been designated as “forever wild,” a major legal hurdle that the project would have great difficulty overcoming. 

Of greatest concern for my constituents, Premium’s proposal would also represent a substantial risk for the city’s water supply. Catskill Moutainkeeper, a regional environmental advocacy group, has stated that the project has the potential to increase turbidity in the Ashokan, stirring up solids and compromising the quality of the reservoir. Turbidity is already a challenge for the Ashokan, and this project presents an unacceptable threat to the water supply of over 9 million New Yorkers. 

Premium has argued that hydroelectric power is a necessary component of moving to fully green energy sources, as they’re able to provide power at night when solar and wind power are less effective. I do not disagree - I am committed to New York State’s plans to move toward renewable energy, and believe that hydroelectricity will be essential to meeting our goals. We are lucky that New York State has a number of waterways that would be good candidates for smaller scale hydroelectric projects that would make use of our existing landscape and produce minimal impacts on the surrounding land and communities. Premium states that the value of the plant they propose is in the substantial amount of energy that would be captured, but that energy is not worth the impacts or risk, especially when the opportunity for more suitable projects exists. 

The Ashokan Reservoir also provides a substantial economic benefit to its surrounding communities. The Ashokan Rail Trail, which opened in 2019, offers 11.5 miles of accessible trail that gives users access to the north rim of the reservoir for the first time in  a century. The Rail Trail has proven to be extremely popular, drawing users from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and beyond, and bringing millions of dollars in local spending with them. The economy of the region relies on the Rail Trail’s recreational value, as well as the many investments New York State has made to support agriculture and a growing industry of craft beers and spirits distillers that depend on other fresh water sources that could be imperiled by extensive construction in the areas around the reservoir. The Rail Trail has been especially valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering New York City residents and others a safe place to get outside and enjoy nature while remaining socially distanced. The extensive construction required by Premium’s proposal would substantially impact the use and enjoyment of this important resource, and with it the economy and health of the region.  

I encourage FERC to support projects that show a deep understanding of the natural resources being developed; include the meaningful engagement of local and impacted governments and communities; and whose risks to communities are minimal unless shown to be absolutely necessary. The Premium proposal meets none of those standards, and instead risks the contamination of New York City’s drinking water and the wellbeing of upstate communities. For these reasons, I ask that you reject this application.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose

I am Gretchen Hartman. I have lived at 945 Woodland Valley Road, Phoenicia since July 1977.

I am writing to urge you to reject the deeply flawed proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains.

This project must be rejected because it will have a serious negative economic impact on the region.  And an additional complexity as implementation of this project would require a NYS Constitutional Amendment involving passage through both Houses of New York State Legislature and a sign off by the Governor. 

The proposed project would disrupt the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve, 700,000 acres of critical habitat in an increasingly fragmented world. It will Flood over 200 acres of private land and protected state forests to construct a new reservoir

The new reservoir would be connected to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel up to 50 feet wide and many miles long, drilled under both public and private lands, and the erection of 12.9 miles of 230kV high-tension transmission lines.

It will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for 9 million New York residents. It will severely disrupt existing regional wells and septic systems which in turn will negatively affect the quality of water regionally and in New York City.  

Premium Energy, in a proposal that demonstrates total lack of understanding of the Catskill region, misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, negatively impact the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers.

I urge you, to reject the Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

I have been a lifelong resident of the Hudson Valley, and although I have lived in many other places in my life, I always come back to here. This is largely due to the environmental integrity of the Catskills, the Shawangunks, and everything in between. This land is so sacred, and moving forward with this project I ensure you will bring immense damage to the integrity of the land that keeps people like me coming back. This will be devastating to the ecosystem, the water supply, and the the beauty of the natural landscape.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

To whom it may concern:

I am writing in strong opposition to Premium Energy&#39;s proposal to build a hydroelectric dam in the Catskills.   The impacts of such a construction project would be devastating to the wildlife, water supply, and people&#39;s homes and businesses.  This project does not have the consent of the communities it will impact the most, let alone the people in NYC who drink the water from the current reservoir.  

While I am not a resident of this area, I have family that has lived on Woodland Valley road since 1977.  I spent the winters and summers of my youth there tubing on the Esopus, hiking Giant&#39;s Ledge, and camping in Woodland Valley State Park.  Now I bring my own children there to take enjoy this beautiful section of New York. To lose these natural resources and rob people of these experiences would be an unforgivable crime.   

Do not allow this project to move forward.

This land was designated many years ago as “Forever Wild”, as it should remain for generations to come. There is no excuse for the proposed compromise beyond the selfish exploitation of protected resources. These types of actions can not be undone and will certainly prove destructive if not disastrous, and directly impact the beauty of our beloved Catskill region.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to express concern and voice opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant and storage dam/reservoir in the Catskill Mountains of New York State (Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056).  The plans for this project are vague and poorly described in the proposal, and have been egregiously misrepresented in their application to FERC.

Two of the three options proposed--Alternatives 1 and 2 in the application--will flood large sections of land that is designated Wilderness Preserve by New York State, protected under Article XIV of the state constitution, which states that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

For over 40 years New York State has been fiercely protective of the ecology of the Mid-Hudson Valley, particularly of those lands that fall within the watershed providing potable unfiltered drinking water to the 9 million residents of New York City. Any effort to compromise these lands will certainly be met with a protracted legal challenge by the state, and I have to wonder if Premium Energy has taken into account in their plans the lengthy, costly, and well-publicized resistance they are sure to meet.

The third proposed location (Application 3)--as it is described in the proposal--would almost certainly require severing north-south access on State Rt. 214. Even a brief topographical study of the terrain leading north to Stony Clove Notch makes clear the impossibility of providing vehicular access around such a dam and reservoir.  NYS Rt. 214 is the only road between Ulster and Greene counties for 25 miles, and the vehicular fuel necessary to circumvent this loss of access to residential, commercial and recreational traffic is sure to offset any possible benefit of energy storage provided by the facility.

Finally, Premium Energy Holdings describes the facility inaccurately to FERC.  Page 11 of the proposal states “The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would operate in a closed loop.”  This is not correct; the Ashokan is not a closed waterway, but part of the continuous flow of water from the upper reaches of the Catskills to the Hudson River. Such a clear oversight--if not intentional misrepresentation--in their proposal should alone disqualify Premium Energy from approval for a preliminary permit.

I thank you for the opportunity to express my opposition to this proposal.

Best Regards

It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country. My children attended a YMCA camp in the Catskills for eight summers. As part of that camp, they hiked and camped in preserve. To think that any part of the preserve would be compromised, is so disheartening.

Docket number P-15056-000 

Dear Secretary Bose,

We strongly oppose Premium Energy’s proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant, in NYS’s Catskill Mountains.  We urge the Commission to reject their request for any kind of permit for the Ashokan pumped storage project (P-15056-000).  It would:
•	Highly disrupt many local communities
•	Contaminate NYC’s drinking water
•	Devastate the natural environment

The pumped storage and hydroelectric project could play a role in the United States transition to renewable energy, but the pristinely protected forests, streams and wildlife of the Catskill Forest Preserve cannot and must not be sacrificed.  Article XIV of the New York State Constitution guarantees that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”.  The Catskill Preserve currently consists of 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat and the forest surrounding the proposed sites rank among the top 1% of forest habitats in the region, as per the State Forest Condition Index.  It would be a horror to destroy this jewel of land and set a terrible precedent.

We understand that pumped storage is known to destroy the ecology of water and land habitats. In the complicated process of a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as water is pumped in both directions. 
This will affect:
•	Wildlife
•	Trout breeding waters
•	The Esopus Creek feeding the Ashokan Reservoir

In addition, we are concerned about people losing their homes and creating an even further shortage of housing. We worry about the negative consequences to the tourism industry, the economic engine of the area. Recreational activities like hiking and fishing would be seriously altered, especially since the area has so long been a “trout capital” of the nation.  We also are concerned about threatening or endangering certain animal species of the region.

Lastly, we have been informed by reputable sources of questionable statements made by Premium Energy Holdings, as stated in their plan.
Needless to say, we are terribly alarmed.  Please reject Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a permit.

Sincerely,

William A. Apfel

Dear Ms. Bose

I am Elizabeth Riklin. I live at 10649 Montrose Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland and for the past 45 years, my family and I have been visiting Woodland Valley, Phoenicia.

I am writing to you to urge you to reject the deeply flawed proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains.

I urge that the project be rejected because it would have a highly negative impact not only on the people, wildlife and organizations in Catskill region, but also the 9 million residents of New York City. The proposed project would severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir, the source of 40% of NYC drinking water, and surrounding streams. 

While I fully support efforts to develop  green-energy sources, this proposed effort would destroy protected wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife and contaminate local wells and septic systems, in addition to negatively impact the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers.

As a resident of both New York City and West Shokan, I stand in firm opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ ill-conceived proposal for a Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 15056 - a proposal which would have a serious negative impact on both communities.  

The Ashokan Reservoir was built over 100 years ago for the sole purpose of providing drinking water for NYC and now provides 40% of the drinking water for its 9.5 million people.  Subsequently, the streams that flow into it are strictly monitored and protected, as are the surrounding lands and forests so as not to disrupt NYC’s water quality and quantity.  Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a hydroelectric pump station in the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir would violate strict regulations of the surrounding land and water use.  It would increase turbidity in both the streams and reservoir, thus negatively impacting the drinking water for over  9.5  million people in the City of New York. 

The building of this reservoir over 100 years ago destroyed 12 towns and displaced 1000’s of people.  Now, Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to build a hydroelectric pump station in the Ashokan Reservoir, along with tunnels, dams, turbines and additional reservoirs, would again displace and/or destroy surrounding communities, as well as destroy parts of the Catskill Forest Preserves.  The Catskill Forest Preserves are protected by New York State and considered as Status #1 land.  Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Any change in land management of  the Catskill Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. This, in itself, should prove how seriously ill-conceived and flawed this proposal by Premium Energy Holdings is.

Additionally, with climate change, we have already been witnessing frequent drought conditions in the upper basin of the Ashokan, therefore already rendering unreliable the amount of water available just to adequately meet NYC’s needs which is the primary and sole purpose for the existence of the Ashokan Reservoir in the first place.  Building a hydroelectric pump station would compete for usage of the same water supplying NYC and would subsequently be an additional strain on the system.  This would result in both systems being seriously compromised and rendered incapable of performing the functions they were meant to fulfill. 

Sustainable and renewable energy is important, but it must be done with a smart, well researched,  and well considered plan.  This plan is ill-conceived and full of outrageous assumptions and even more serious flaws not mentioned here.  

Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward and deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-1.

Thank you.

RE: FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA.

Dear Ms. Bose;

As a resident of West Shokan, NY and the preserved lands of the Catskill Watershed, I am writing to protest the application of Premium Energy Holdings LLC for a pumped storage system in this area.  

1.	 The application refers to a closed loop system.  This is false.  They plan to create a secondary body of water, rather than connect an existing body of water, to the Ashokan Reservoir.  This is not a closed loop system but an add-on system which, aside from the fact that it is not energy efficient as claimed, would have a negative impact on a.  the environment and the endangered species and waterways therein b.  create turbidity and pollution in the streams of the Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir, the former containing a fragile trout population/ecosystem and the latter supplying 40% of New York City’s drinking water and c. countermanding NY State Constitutional Article XIV, which states that the lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

2.	It is required by law that any change to this land provision requires an amendment to the state Constitution, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.


3.	The lands surrounding this proposed referendum would necessitate the implementation of Eminent Domain, a process that is unacceptable in these preserved lands – a process that can devastate both public and private properties in the area now as it did when the original Ashokan Reservoir project was built in 1905.

4.	The county of Ulster contains a highly valuable tourism business with a commensurate employment rate, all of which would be disrupted by the proposed Storage project.  Premium Energy’s proposal would limit access to hiking, fishing , dining, and skiing as well as other forms of entertainment and recreation in the area.

All told, The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project has been submitted under false pretenses, is antithetical to the fundamentals of “Green Energy” and would have a long-term, negative impact on the lives of local community members and the fragile, preserved Catskill Watershed lands in which they have chosen to live.

Respectfully yours,

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to ask that FERC decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

I am situated nearby and have been appraised of the negative impact this project will pose for the environment- and the drinking water of NYC.

Thanks for your time,

Ron Cohen</pre><hr><b>Comments of Howard Widensky under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/8/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>howard widensky, Phoenicia, NY.
I am a resident of Woodland Valley, Phoenicia NY.
I am completely disturbed by this proposal for a permit to be submitted or approved for Premium Energy Holdings,LLC. Have these people researched the area in question at all? Do they care about the natural resources at all?
At this time the project site is inside of Catskill Forest Preserve, and would destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885, and the NYS Constitution states that the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands, [and] shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The forests around the proposed sites rank among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, and are considered Status 2 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
Are you aware that at any time in this preserved area that a home owner needs to do repairs of any kind that involve the land, we have to get special permissions and approvals from The State agencies of DEC and DEP especially when it comes to septic systems. We cannot do anything without their watchful eye to make sure our ground waters are not contaminated. As homeowners we have come to expect excellence in protecting our natural surroundings. This has got to be addressed that a proposal and project of this magnitude will destroy our homes, our environments and natural surroundings. One can read any magazine these days and see that the Catskills are a tourist destination now. It is ever so popular and has remained that way all during the 2020 Pandemic. Do not let this California based company come and destroy our home! Let them do in in their own backyard... Not ours!

As a Saugerties resident and frequent hiker and paddler, I oppose the granting of a preliminary license for this proposal. This project is not in the best interest of the people or the environment of the Hudson Valley, and it is so wrong that no local stakeholders have been consulted on it. The Catskill Forest Preserve is beloved and State Constitutionally protected, which should not be taken lightly.

This project would irreversibly harm sensitive ecosystems we have long fought to protect throughout the Preserve, from the powerline right-of-ways to the dams and the powerhouse itself. It will also likely lead to the introduction of even more invasive species. During and after construction, hikers will be denied access to the trails and views that are part of our New York heritage. Many of these hikers will be diverted to other trails that are already struggling under overuse and cannot withstand further ecological degradation. Depending on the location, roads will have to be rerouted, causing even more disruption to people and our forest land.

I support the shift to renewable energy, and we need to do it intelligently. Pumped storage is a net consumer of energy, not a producer of it. It doesn’t make sense to cause all this disruption in an ecologically rich and sensitive area for a project that isn’t actually moving us forward. There is no upside for our forests and waterways in this proposal, and there is no upside for all of us trail users from near and far. At the very least, this proposal needs serious consideration and input from all municipalities affected by it before the FERC grants any preliminary license.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Kimberly Fisher under P-15056.

I am an avid recreational user of the Catskills. I hike and kayak there and love the natural scenic beauty. I&#39;m very upset to learn about this proposal. 

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 

This plan would also increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water. It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive. The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities. The plan could also limit access to skiing, festivals, and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.

Please take all of this into consideration as we urge you to not move forward with this project. Thank you.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Christopher Puleo under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Christopher Puleo, Hamburg, NJ.
Hello,

I am writing today to express my direct opposition to the proposed hydroelectric facility that would irreversibly damage areas of the Catskill Forest Preserve.

Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California has proposed a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve that would have negative impacts on the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding area. This proposal directly threatens the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, the quality of the New York City water supply, and so much more.

I am writing my concerns regarding the proposed hydroelectric plant at Ashokan Reservoir, submitted by Premium Energy. This proposal should not be considered without input from New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and local leaders and stakeholders. 
If Premium Energy had consulted with the above groups, they likely would not have proposed building the hydroelectric plant in a Forever Wild area. Any amendment to a Forever Wild area should be carefully considered, considering the loss of extremely valuable habitat, species, and water supply protection these lands provide. Additionally, any historic structures in the vicinity of the proposal should be studied carefully and avoided if possible, before the proposal even initially proceeds. 
It seems the Premium Energy has not carefully considered the location of the hydroelectric plant from the onset of the project and does not value the input of local stakeholders. Please hold Premium Energy accountable for providing the state of New York a project that provides clear benefits and considerations to the environment and people.</pre><hr><b>Comments of David A Copperman under P-15056.

Re: Project Docket P-15056

Ashokan Pumped Storage Project Proposal

 

The Town of Olive has a great natural beauty that is breath taking to behold. It is shared by all of us, as our greatest source and asset. It should be respected and treated as such. It must be guarded and protected by all of us. In these times, it is more fragile than ever before. It can be easily attacked and damaged beyond repair. This proposal in itself shows this to be true. It is our duty to pass on this great natural beauty to future generations, untouched and pristine. How could a project of this size and scope even be allowed, for consideration as a proposal, within the boundaries of the forever wild blue line of the Catskill Park? How could high voltage transmission lines be allowed in forever wild? No, this must not come to be!

In many ways this project would be very harmful to the Town of Olive. Although it would only despoil this side of the reservoir, the high voltage transmission lines would be quite visible from both the Ashokan dam and dike parks but also the Ashokan rail trail as well. It would also be visible from many mountain top trails! This would be an awful eyesore and distract from our towns’ best attractions. This must not come to be! Therefore I am vehemently opposed to and against this proposed project! It would be a devastating catastrophe for West Shokan and many other places.

As for me, the high voltage transmission lines would pass within a few hundred feet of my home. I would undoubtedly be forced to move away and leave the area, after 50 plus years. My life and this side of the reservoir as I know it will be over. Then as I move south, what then will my house be worth? Somewhere less than half of its current value? This must not come to be!

The benefits of this project to our town and area are little to none. On the balance sheet this is a big negative for us. It is worth far more for us not to have this damaging project, generating electricity for other remote places. The few permanent jobs this would create are not worth it, do not be fooled!

This project is unnecessary as people all over continue to put up more solar panels. Offshore wind would be closer to where this power is needed, with fewer transmission lines. Offshore wind would not be disruptive or ruin mountain views; it would be more gentle and politically correct for these times. Is there really such a shortage of electric power that this must be built within a very beautiful and protected park? Where it is not wanted by the people? I don’t think so, no, this must not come to be.

It is my sincere hope that every person and party in the Town of Olive and everyone in the affected areas of this project will join me in my opposition. Together with everyone who loves and cares and wants this project this special part of our environment, united in opposition to his very bad idea and unnecessary project. Let us all put a stop to this project now before it gains any traction.

Over 100 years ago, against the will of its citizens, New York City caused West Shokan and much of Olive to be forced out and flooded over. Now is an opportune and crucial time for our good friends at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to protect their reservoir ( by avoiding unnecessary torpidity), and join together as allies with the Town of Olive in opposition to this unwanted proposal.

Everyone in opposition to this project should think about what we can all do to be a most effective force. We must plan to work together, organize and coordinate. We must all fight this tooth and nail! We must stop this misguided and unnecessary proposal. We must stop this project before it starts, and for good. Remember there is so much at stake. We have so much to lose that once blighted we could never get back!

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Secretary Bose:
I am writing to request that this application be rejected on the basis that it contains a serious defect. The applicants rely upon the designation of this project as a closed loop system which it is not.
 
Premium Energy Holdings’ Application for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project states the project would “operate in a closed loop. Aside from evaporation and percolation losses, [the proposal claims] the project’s water would stay within the system.” The Project proposes to use the existing Ashokan Reservoir as a lower pool and a new reservoir in the Catskill Mountains to serve as the upper pool.
  
U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s (DOE&#39;s) Water Power Technologies Office defines closed-loop PSH as “not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature” and open-loop Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) as “continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature.”(1)

The Ashokan Reservoir, which is proposed to be the lower reservoir of the system, receives water from the Esopus Creek.  Although streamflow in the Esopus is altered by diversion of water from the Schoharie Creek watershed to the Esopus Creek through the Shandaken Tunnel, overall, the Esopus Creek continues to be a naturally flowing water feature with estimates of natural discharge reflecting the absence of effects of flows in the Esopus Creek over broad time frames.(2)

Water from the Ashokan Reservoir flows naturally, by gravity, into a system of reservoirs, and ultimately into New York City’s distribution system.(3) Importantly, there is a continuous flow of water out of the Ashokan Reservoir into the Lower Esopus.(4)

Therefore, the proposed lower reservoir for the system is continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature, the Esopus Creek.  The designation of this project as a closed loop system, a critical distinction in the review process, is defective and the proposal should be rejected on this basis.

Sincerely

Ashokan Proposal to FERC for a Pumped Storage Add-On* Project in the Catskill State 

       Forest Preserve

 

 

Dear Ms. Bose:

 

We all understand the need for electrical power infrastructure, and most of us see the imperative to replace fossil fuels, but must ask At what cost?  The Catskills Park is a critical watershed, a recreation area, and a protected ecological and scenic reserve. Because the proposed pumped storage project will adversely affect this essential watershed and forest preserve, I submit that the cost is too high. Please deny this request by Premium Energy for a preliminary permit.

 

In considering this project, FERC is being asked to bargain with dangerous trade-offs – electricity vs. water safety and security; electricity vs. a vitally important tourism economy.

 

Concerns about Water -

The Ashokan Reservoir System is fed into by the Schoharie Reservoir and Esopus Creek. It is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation. The Ashokan supplies 40% of New York City water to some 19 million people. With this proposed pumped storage project:

-       The turbidity of the Reservoir is likely to increase, impacting the quality of the water

-       Sediment changes in tributaries to the Esopus will alter sediment in the Esopus proper as well as the Ashokan Reservoir because they are all connected; *this is not a closed-loop project

 

Economic Concern -

Catskill Tourism is integral to the New York State economy.

-      Tourism is a $1.6 billion industry supporting ca 20,000 jobs

-      Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019 (and is

                     growing)

 Earth-moving blastings/construction trucks and noise, will be destructive to habitats, jarring to the peace and beauty of the natural environment, thereby eating away at what makes the Catskills desirable and therefore a place people want to visit, live and work.

 

As residents -- whether new, multi-generational, or part-time with second homes outside of New York City, of all ages, incomes, political persuasions, etc. – we are joining together with our elected officials and civic/environmental organizations to prevent this harmful project. We understand that any changes in our State Forest Preserve must be passed by constitutional amendment voted on by two consecutive sessions of the NY State Legislature, and submitted to the public in a referendum. We stand committed to see this battle through, as long as the legal, legislative and lobbying actions may take, but we hope and pray that FERC will join us now in rejecting project P-15056 at an early stage, before years of great cost, litigation and angst.

 

Thank you for your careful consideration of this urgent matter.

 

Sincerely,

I am writing in regards to the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project - I am STRONGLY AGAINST this project taking place in any of the three proposed locations. 

As a resident of Palenville, I know that the Catskills are a small mountain range, and there is limited access to the mountaintop. Any dam built, specifically the dam proposal along Route 214, would funnel traffic and human impact onto roads that are already over capacity, drastically inhibiting tourism, which is the biggest industry we rely on in the region. Our infrastructure can not handle any more traffic -  our rivers are clogged with trash, the vehicle traffic is insane, and human impact is severe and needs to be mitigated.

In addition, the NYState constitution clarifies the preservation of the Catskills to be untouched and left as wilderness. In a dissipating “wild” landscape, this is of utmost primary concern. The resources that the Catskills have to offer exceed just tourism, but also provide a sanctuary to the LIMITED natural resources of water, fresh air, and animal life that we all depend on as humans. To impose a dam which would DRASTICALLY change the landscape of a space that is CRITICAL to preserve would be an irreversible and tragic error. It would affect not only the natural ecosystems, but the water supply directly tied to *8.3 million people in New York City*. I don’t think anyone needs to deal with a problem that large on their hands.

Please DENY the permits that would only benefit a for-profit company that does not even operate from within New York State, but from across the country in California. New York’s Catskill Mountains is not a place for extraction of resources, but a delicate mountain range that needs to be left as it is to preserve and honor the current laws in place as well as the protection of the natural landscape and it’s limited resources.

The dam should NOT be built in an environment as fragile as the Catskill Mountains.

To whom it may concern,

I’m very concerned about the proposed hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve that would impact the Ashokan Reservoir. This proposal directly threatens the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, and the quality of the NYC water supply. In addition, it would significantly and negatively impact the use surrounding trails. As an avid trail user, this is very important to me.

Premium Energy’s Ashokan Reservoir Pumped Storage Project

Docket: P-15056

I respectfully request that Premium Energy’s permit application for the above project be denied.
  
There are major factual errors and omissions in Premium’s current application:

1)	In its initial application, Premium incorrectly states, “The lands enclosed within the proposed project boundary are New York State Lands.”  This is simply wrong.  The proposed Wittenberg reservoir is also sited on private residential property.  Premium acknowledges immediately after that “The project layout study boundary…encompasses both federal and private lands.”  There are no federal lands here. By misrepresenting the location of the upper reservoir, which is on numerous parcels of private land as well as State land, Premium hides that taking parcels of private land by Eminent Domain and devaluing numerous residential properties downstream, will be integral to the project.

2)	Premium fails to disclose in its maps or descriptions that the path it has selected for miles of high-voltage, high-tension wires would also be on private property .  This would also involve taking residential property and/or New York City watershed property through Eminent Domain.

3)	Premium wrongly characterizes the project as a Closed Loop project.  This is completely incorrect.  This is an add-on Open Loop project.  The U.S. Department of Energy defines the difference: “PSH capabilities can be characterized as open loop-where there is an ongoing hydrologic connection to a natural body of water-or closed loop, where the reservoirs are not connected to an outside body of water.” (www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower).  This project involves the Esopus Creek, Maltby Hollow Brook and Ashokan Reservoir, all of which are comprised of running water at both ends. Premium’s project fails to qualify as a Closed Loop under any circumstances.  It is evident that Premium has deliberately mischaracterized the project in an attempt to secure expedited processing and to skirt the standard review process.  FERC has sometimes ruled that the distinction between Open and Closed Loop is not grounds for rejection at this stage in the process. In this case, however, the factual error affects the drinking water of 9 million people.  This mistake should be corrected before the applicant can proceed. Furthermore, Premium Energy should not be allowed any expedited permitting or licensing.

4)	Premium failed to notify several relevant municipalities that are clearly impacted by this project.  There was no notification to the Town of Hunter or to Greene County.  There was no identification or notification to the Towns of Marbletown or Hurley (where the high-voltage wires would be built).  These towns have populations of more than 5,000 people.  In its deficiency letter, FERC points out that “the Commission’s regulations require the applicant to identify every city, town, or similar local political subdivision which has a population of 5,000 or more people.”  It is up to Premium Energy, not the responsibility of FERC, to correctly identify and inform these political entities.  The current application is incomplete. Relevant municipalities have not been properly notified.  To say that these municipalities know now, by word-of-mouth, is an inadequate response.

5)	  Premium wrongly identifies the affected body of water on the first page of its executive summary.  Premium lists the “Bush Kill Creek,” in addition to the Ashokan Reservoir.  The actual affected body of water is the “Maltby Hollow Brook.”  Premium does not use the correct name until page 11 of its application.  The difference here is substantial.  The mouth of the Maltby Hollow flows into the Bush Kill.  It is the Maltby Hollow that will be “impounded.”  While it is not wrong to include the Bush Kill, it is incorrect to omit Maltby Hollow Brook.  This is akin to proposing a project in Pittsburgh that would impound the Ohio River, but listing the Mississippi River as the only affected waterway.

6)	Premium Energy failed to adequately answer FERC’s deficiency comment about emergency spillways.   FERC correctly noted that Premium “does not mention any emergency spillways for the upper reservoir. If applicable, please provide dimensions and the general configuration for any emergency spillways.”  All Premium did in its amendment was say there would be a “concrete spillway” without providing any details.  This is an insufficient response. The Wittenberg reservoir is in an area that is so prone to flooding that flood insurance is required as a condition of receiving a mortgage.  Before approval of the permit, Premium Energy needs to specify, at a minimum, the details and dimensions of the spillway, as required in FERC’s letter of deficiencies.  This is especially important because there are many people who live immediately downstream from the dam.

7)	In its deficiency letter, FERC notes that “the scale of (your) maps is not sufficient to show clearly and legibly all of the information. Please revise and submit the maps enlarged to a scale that is adequate for that purpose.”  Premium Energy has again failed to provide legible maps in its resubmission.  All they did was to blow up fuzzy maps that continue to obscure the names of towns, roads and other relevant site information.

Due to the numerous factual errors in its original and amended applications and failure to correct the deficiencies already noted by FERC in its initial response on December 29, 2020, the application of Premium Energy should be denied.  At the very least, Premium Energy should be compelled to resubmit their application, correcting all of the deficiencies. Premium Energy should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to proceed to the next phase based on its amended application dated January 29, 2021.  Moreover, if Premium Energy is given permission to proceed, they should not be allowed any expedited processing.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Joe Lauriello</pre><hr><b>Comments of Graham Brown under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Graham Brown, Westhampton Beach, NY.
To The FERC,

	I’m writing this letter in response to Premium Energy LLC’s proposal to construct a hydroelectric dam within the Catskill Forest Preserve. Although hydroelectric energy is an essential step in shaping a greener and better energy future for our country, this proposal is deeply flawed. It would have dire consequences for the state of New York. 

	The first and perhaps most pressing of these consequences would be the dam’s effect on the Ashokan Reservoir. As it stands right now, the reservoir is protected. But if the dam were approved, it would increase the turbidity and pollution in the reservoir, which supplies drinking water to 40% of New York City residents. It would be a severe moral transgression to put these citizens’ lives and health at risk just as the state is recovering from the carnage of COVID-19. 

	Additionally, in order to construct the dam, private property would have to be taken through eminent domain. This seizure of property would displace our communities that have long called the Catskills home. Thousands of Catskill residents were already displaced once when the reservoir was built; uprooting these communities again would be unjustifiably cruel. 

	And finally, the dam would wreak havoc on the highly prized and preserved forests, wildlife, and ecology of the area. Green energy is the future. But if we have to destroy our world to get there, is the energy truly green at all? 

	Thank you for taking the time to listen to my comments. I hope you find that Premium Energy’s dam does not meet the bar for sustainable green energy and reject their proposal.

It has come to my attention that there has been an application with the intended end of creating a &#34;pumped storage&#34; project on lands that currently serve the public good for residents of New York State.  The land identified for the project is a State preserve protected by the NY State constitution.  The proposed changes will not only threaten local wildlife and ecosystems, but will remove valuable outdoor recreation opportunities from the citizens of the local communities.  Additionally the proposed changes will negatively impact the drinking water which is consumed by myself and my children.

Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Collin LaFleche, West Shokan, NY.
Hello,

My name is Collin LaFleche. I live in West Shokan NY, on the southern side of the Ashokan Reservoir. My partner and I are here returning the property into a working organic farm, growing vegetables and fruit. Our property would likely be impacted by the infrastructure required for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, and so I wanted to submit a comment regarding the proposal.

I am certainly not an engineer, but I am a project manager, and the proposal on its face is incomplete, sloppy, does not approach the overall goals at hand — renewable energy storage — from a thoughtful standpoint, and in the way that the Department of Energy has stated it wants. Specifically, this would be an open-loop project, not a closed-loop project as the DOE has requested. The proposal states this is a closed-loop project, but this is incorrect, as the Ashokan has an outflow on its southeast end.

Secondly, there are likely to be significant legal challenges facing this proposal and project. The state is almost certainly going to object on various grounds. Significantly, any changes to land management for the state forest preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, ratified by public referendum. Through 1999, 2000 or more amendments were proposed, with only 20 passing.

Most importantly, the project would have detrimental impacts on the land and stream ecologies in the areas surrounding the Ashokan Reservoir, ecologies which are highly preserved. The lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve are protected by the state constitution and may not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any public or private corporation. The forest surrounding the proposed sites is, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index, among the top 1% of forest habitats in the region. All of the proposed reservoirs are within the Audubon Society’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area. Finally, the Catskills are categorized as status 1 land as part of the USGS “Gap Analysis Program,” which means that it should be “avoided for development.” 

Premium Energy appears to be unaware that the project would encounter the above challenges, speaking further to the unseriousness of their proposal.

I urge you to reject Premium Energy’s proposal on the grounds that it is incomplete, inaccurate, and poorly assembled.

Thanks very much for your time,

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I know you are probably receiving a lot of these but I believe deeply in all of these words below. Please decline the preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pump Storage Project. 

I am writing against the troubling proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000
 
Dear Ms. Bose,
 
The Catskills and the surrounding areas have become my sanctuary in a world that has gone through so many troubling times.  I am all for clean energy, but not at the expense of nature and the environment that it is supposed to protect.
 
I am writing to you, urging you and your team at FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the place I call home. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is incredibly flawed. Bringing this to life would mean destroying an ecosystem, disrupting local communities, and risking the purity of NYC’s drinking water. This idea is not worth the negative long-term cost.
 
Here’s a bulleted list as to why this idea is flawed:
 
Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife and ecosystem are at risk of being tampered with. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. It would be a complete shame to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Pumped storage wreaks havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. My home is part of the Ashokan watershed and I know how delicate the ecosystem is. Without a doubt of the rough water continuously moving up and doing that it would impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.

The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, which I am a part of. This project would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced. 

The proposed project would effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 
The project would impair the connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.
 
I could outline many more reasons, but overall, this project will directly hurt the environment, local community and even tourism. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

I am writing in concern with the Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California has proposed a pumped storage hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve. This facility would have a significant negative impact on the lands by eliminating vital  access to popular trailheads and recreation areas. Closing these areas would put undue strain on the remaining trailheads and would magnify negative ecological impacts seen by increased trail use during the pandemic.  As a trail maintained I am significantly concerned with the negative impact on the various habits and ecosystems that are currently protected as a State preserve by the NY State constitution. The construction of these new dams would irreversibly damage the native flora and fauna which make the state preserve such a treasured place in our community. Furthermore, this project would have a significant impact on tourism and the business revenue which benefits from this. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ellen Carl under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ellen Carl, West Shokan, NY.
As a lifetime resident of Ulster County, I am writing to ask you to deny the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The environmental impact this project would have on the surrounding area, not to mention the potential impact on New York City’s water supply, would be far more devastating than the benefits such a project would have to the electrical grid. 

The project proposes to use private and state land. That state land is part of the Catskill Forest Preserve, which has been designated as “forever wild” under the New York State Constitution. It is “status one” land that the Department of Energy itself says should be avoided for development.

A pumped storage facility, not to mention the years of heavy construction needed to build it, would wreak havoc on the local streams and the surrounding land habitats. It would also displace residents and have a negative impact tourism, which is a major source of jobs in the region.

Even though we undoubtedly need to upgrade our electrical grid in this country and make it more “green,” these kinds of projects do not seem to be the kinds of projects the department should be developing given they are net consumers of energy and not producers. 

Please deny the preliminary permit application by Premium Energy Holdings.

Re: Docket number P-15056-000, Premium Energy Proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project 

Dear Commissioners, 

I write in strong opposition to the proposed pump storage project in the Ashokan Watershed and Catskills State Preserve.  Pumped storage makes sense in very particular settings, but this is not one of them.  The ecological disruption that would be caused by this proposal, which is not a true “closed loop” system, is immense.  The real and unwarranted risks to the area include:

-	Risks to the purity of New York City’s water supply.  The Ashokan provides 40% of that supply, and would take billions of dollars to replace.

-	Disruption of the local habitat and fisheries.  Pumped storage creates major fluctuations in water levels and alters stream sediment, harming local fish and recreational fishing.

-	Damage to the Catskills Preserve.  The preserve is pristine and considered Status 1 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. These are to be avoided for development, according to the DOE’s own Hydropower Vision.  The proposal would inundate more than 200 acres for the reservoir and associated roads, dam and other infrastructure.  This would lead to carbon loss, and irreversibly impact local wildlife.  

-	Disruption of the local community.  The project would inundate much of Woodland Valley and do significant damage to tourism in an area where much of the local economy is tourism-dependent.

I support clean energy, and strongly support proposals to introduce real green energy in sensible ways.  But this cannot be the way that we green the economy.  There is nothing suitable about this setting, and we will do grave damage to the political will needed to really bring green energy about if we contemplate proposals like these.

To Whom It may Concern,

  The following project proposal of a Hydroelectric Plant on Ashokan Reservoir will have long lasting negative impacts for the local environment of the Catskills area. I am all for eliminating greenhouse emissions, however not at the expense of the local community. Not only will the people living nearby be at risk for possible flooding, but the habitat of the dam and land will be greatly impacted too. During the warmer season, I enjoy taking time away from the chaos of the world and going into nature whether it be hiking or fishing (catch &amp; release). If this hydroelectric plant were to be built, hiking in that area would slowly decrease along with the fishing which will eventually also affect the feeding cycle of the ecosystem. During the colder season, I find myself enjoying winter activities at Hunter mountain. If the dam were to be built it&#39;ll impact the mountain as well. I vacation up frequently at the Catskills and enjoy the solitude the area has to offer. I am from the NJ/NYC area, if this dam were built not only would my vacation spot be greatly impacted, my hometown tap water would also be greatly impacted. Please reconsider your proposal to help maintain the sacred and already stable environment of Ashokan Reservoir. Thank you for your time.

Re:  docket number P-15056-000
My partner and I live in Greene County and frequently travel through Ulster County and take advantage of recreational opportunities at the Ashokan Reservoir.  Our closest friends have lived in West Hurley for 30 years.
I oppose the proposal put forward by Premium Energy to FERC to study the feasibility of a massive program that will disrupt the Catskill State Preserve.
My principal concerns include: 
--the disruption to the lives of residents uprooted by the process of eminent domain
--ecological impact and threat to NYC drinking water due to increased turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed
--the Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution (“shall be kept forever wild”)
--loss of recreational opportunity 
--Premium Energy’s fundamental justification of project as “closed loop” when in fact the upper reservoir component is clearly an “add-on”.  This is dishonest on its face.
Please deny Premium Energy’s request to proceed with a feasibility study.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lisa Mansback Berk under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lisa Mansback Berk, Vestal, NY.
The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>(doc-less) Motion to Intervene of Peter Friedel under P-15056.</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Submission Description: (doc-less) Motion to Intervene of Peter Friedel under P-15056-000.

MOTION TO INTERVENE of Peter Friedel for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

Dear Secretary Bose,

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Therefore, Peter Friedel is filing a motion to be an intervenor and meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations to grant them full party status.

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project which encompasses the private property where one of the proposed site projects would be located- Wittenberg Reservoir/Dam. Hence, Peter Friedel along with his children will lose and not have access to their land as well as to their home which leads them to have substantial interest in the matter, since the property is their primary residence which is located on 55 Friedel Drive that is directly off Moonhaw Road, West Shokan, NY 12494. 

Peter Friedel respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Though I live in Philadelphia, my mom and many other close family and friends live in the Catskills region and I visit often. The project they are proposing, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water. Because of this I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit.

I know that pumped storage and hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, however the forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a travesty to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats because of the rapid fluctuations of the large mass of water in the upper reservoir as it is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. 

The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Dana Cohen</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lara Cely under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lara Cely, Montclair, NJ.
I&#39;m writing to oppose this application for a large and poorly conceived “pumped storage” project. It would draw from the existing Ashokan Reservoir, plus a newly created dam and reservoir at one of three alternative sites near the Ashokan.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution. The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the natural areas and have significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs. This plan would also negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms.

In conclusion, I oppose this proposal because it directly threatens the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, the quality of the New York City water supply, and so much more.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Adam Sternin under P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am a resident of Hunter Township, NY and live about 5 miles from the proposed Damming of Route 214 as indicated in the proposal from Premium Energy Holdings new hydroelectric project based in the Catskills Preserve. I would like to include my voice of opposition to this proposal. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.

The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic.

The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms.

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience.

This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.

It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.

The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.

The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Susanna Margolis under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Susanna Margolis, New York, NY.

•	The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
•	The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
•	The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
•	The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
•	This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
•	It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
•	Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
•	The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
•	The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.

Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.
In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.
As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?
Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Helen Toomer</pre><hr><b>Comments of Susan Johnson under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Susan Johnson, Croton on Hudson, NY.
I am appalled that the Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California has supplied documents without input from the NYCDEP and the NYSDEC concerning the impact of their plans on the area around the Ashokan Reservoir. Water, land, people and wildlife in protected areas will be adversely affected.

 I am a resident of Croton on Hudson, a  neighbor of one of NYC&#39;s reservoirs, and a hiker, canoer and visitor of the wonderful parks and rivers in the Ashokan Reservoir area. I have enjoyed this area since the late 1990&#39;s. I do not want to see the Forever Wild lands polluted,  and disrupted by noise, or have a loss of contiguous wildlife corridors.  I do not want the Catskill Forest Preserve violated by these things either.  I do not want an out of state entity having legal control over NY State&#39;s and NYC&#39;s water supply.  As my area is contiguous to the New Croton Reservoir and Croton Aqueduct this is personal.

I request that all agencies, municipalities and non-profits currently filing for intervenor status  get 
their chance to submit relevant data about the effect of these plans on the environment. I request that the comment period be extended for another 3 months.

I am extremely disappointed to have recently learned about the proposed dam near Ashokan reservoir. As a resident of the southern Catskills and frequent visitor of all parts of the Catskill region I have to voice my strong opposition to this project for all the reasons I have outlined below.

• The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.

• The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

• The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic.

• The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience.

To whom it may concern,

As president of the High Point Neighbors Association located in West Shokan, NY, I call on FERC to stop the hydroelectric plant proposed by Premium Energy Holdings. 

I list below our initial objections to the granting of a Preliminary Permit by FERC. We feel strongly that the location, and the project overall, is not suitable or viable. Here’s why:

LEGAL ISSUES
-The are falls under Status 1 of the USGS Gap Analysis, and therefore not eligible for development.
-NYS has already expressed severe concern about this project, and it is expected that legal objections to this issue may well elevated to the Supreme Court, increasing costs for all concerned.
-The developer has been dishonest from the onset - the project is NOT closed loop, but an add-on project which is not what the DoE really wants to promote.
-The local area constitutes 700,000 acres of forest habitat and is among the top 1% region wide.  Under Article XIV of the NYS constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forests lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”.

ECOLOGICAL ISSUES
-There are several protected species that will be dramatically damaged by development of this size and impact.
-The impact on the land and streams will be significant. A DoE 2013 study found that rapid fluctuations in water levels (which this project would create) “wreak havoc on the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems overlap.”

SUITABILITY ISSUES
-Hydropower seems to be a net producer of greenhouse gasses overall - true, it reduces gasses from fossil fuels, but reservoirs create methane. The forrest area that would have to be cleared to create the project currently serves to reduce pollution, and this would be lost.
-This is a shortsighted solution from a location point of view, due to uncertainly in the climate here with the potential of a much reduced snowfall and therefore runoff.

FINANCIAL ISSUES
-Local tourism constitutes a major component of the local economy, and due to recent new hiking trails, this is increasing dramatically. This project would irreversibly reduce that revenue and therefore economically damage an area of the State that is already under pressure.

CULTURAL ISSUES
-Although we realize that FERC is not mandated to consider the human impact of proposed projects, I would be remiss if I did not mention that the area’s cultural cohesion was devised when the original Ashokan reservoir was constructed, mostly due to the use of eminent domain to obtain land, and the fragmentation of all the towns that were moved to outlying areas. The through the this will happen again would most probably create a major backlash in the area.

I appreciate your time in reviewing this letter and ask that you take into consideration when reviewing the application.

Although I support renewable energy production in general and specifically for New York City, it should not be accomplished at the expense of the rare natural environment. 

You must understand that this valley has likely the cleanest air, is quietest and contains the most natural environment within 100 linear miles of NYC. This is natural land preserved to “be forever kept as wild forest lands.”

Those of us who depend on this respite from hectic urban life rely on this valley for the experience of nature, and even knowing that it’s there. 

It would be a devastating loss to not have this valley available to my family and me. 

Losing the tourist destination will demand seeking another convenient alternative… in New Jersey or Massachusetts... or further, discouraging frequent visits and diminishing my quality of life.

April 5th 2021

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the problematic proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric pumped storage plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I recommend FERC decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, and I would like to provide my professional reasons for supporting this position. 

I am a materials engineer, an engineering professor, and I run a not for profit (501c3) organization on environmental education, forest school and waste recycling. I am also a local resident and enjoy the beauty of the Catskills. My area of specialization is to consider the social and environmental impact of what engineers do, and I will adopt a similar framework to address my concerns about the proposed hydro pump storage plant, through this letter. It is clear to me and I hope to the readers of this letter, that the negative impacts far outweigh the positives overall, and that we must look closely at who benefits and who pays the cost of these negative impacts in the long term. Who pays the price for the benefit of those who gain?

The idea of pumped storage energy is ostensibly an elegant solution to the need to store energy in areas of weak or changing supply. If done well, and with no negative environmental impact, it would add immeasurably to the suite of tools and facilities currently being developed in support of a just transition away from fossil fuels, so critically necessary in our consideration of climate change and sustainability of resources. 

However, if we look at the potential negative impacts in this case we can see that these are many and they are unevenly distributed. In Table 1 (inspired by the brilliant Ursula Franklin and her ‘Real world of technology’ book by Anansi Press, 1995) a &#43; or - sign is where there is an expected positive or negative impact, either socially, environmentally or economically. Each stakeholder group is taken separately. This table is not complete (there may be stakeholder groups not included) but the categories within serve to support the points being made in this letter. The only group to benefit long term from this project are a private, profit making Californian company. Tourism (with its associated health benefits and local jobs), NY water supply, local residents (who have been fighting the injustice of eminent domain for years), residents within the broader area (who visit the Catskills regularly for leisure and sport), the fauna and particularly the fish, the flora and the entire ecosystem will all pay the costs and suffer the neglect of an adequate and considered approach to solving the challenge of energy storage. This all despite the fact that under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that lands which include the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

There are two critically important points to reinforce relating to the above. Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project claims to be a closed-loop pumped storage projects which has a smaller environmental impact than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval (although closed loop still has its problems). However this is not technically accurate. The system is not closed from local water supply – as the Esopus river runs into the reservoir. Furthermore, the water is drawn from the reservoir for the NY city water supply, which will experience hugely increased turbidity due to the changed water levels. 

I strongly urge you to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. But in addition I would stress the importance of not simply pushing the project further onto other at-risk lands. The company, and others who use this technology needs to do due diligence and research the impacts using independent researchers, to find a solution to the issue of energy storage which adopts the same elegant solution but without creating harm to the environment it had been designed to save. For centuries we have created solutions which seem to be the panacea at the time and only later have we discovered the profound damage that we have caused. Let us set a new pathway where we care for our common home.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

As a local resident and active user of the Ashokan Reservoir, I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing today to urge you and your team at FERC to decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The information that has been made available indicates that this reservoir project and dam construction would be devastating to the place I call home. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is incredibly flawed. Bringing this to life would mean destroying our fragile ecosystem and disrupting local communities. I live in a home that was originally located in what is now the Ashokan Reservoir. The displacement of homes and people in this current climate would breed toxicity. I fear that this initiative will reignite the historical tension between the local community and the tourism that supports our area and provides NYC’s drinking water. This idea is not worth the negative long-term cost.

Here’s a bulleted list as to why this idea is flawed:

•	Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife, and ecosystem are at risk of being tampered with. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of wildlife habitat. It would be irresponsible to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
•	Pumped storage wreaks havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. My home is part of the Ashokan watershed, and I know how delicate the ecosystem is. The redirection of water would impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.
•	The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.
•	Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, which I am a part of. This project would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced. 
•	The proposed project would negatively impact the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 
•	The project would impair the connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

I could outline many more reasons, but overall, this project will directly hurt the environment, local community, and tourism. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

I am a huge fan of summer and winter and fall and spring Hunter area. 

It would be ludicrous to do the proposed, and quite frankly insulting that it is even a thought, no less a possibility. 

Drinking water, existing houses, one less route of ONLY two, that almost all  use to get to Hunter mountain via Thruway.  

I am a tourist to the area. 

I Visit the BEAUTIFUL park along that road. 

THAT ROAD is what makes Hunter area beautiful to arrive at.  and leave from.   One of the few useful and scenic roads to get to and leave Hunter. 

To go into Phonecia.  What about visits to Phonecia ?

I am an avid hiker, skier, and backpacker living in Philadelphia, PA.  Every year and in every season, I make the trip up to the beautiful Catskills to enjoy these activities.  When I am there, I also enjoy stopping in the local towns such as Woodstock, Shandaken, Hunter, and Tannersville, to name a few. 
 Needless to say, while I am visiting, I am also spending money.  I am firmly opposed to the proposed hydroelectric project as it threatens the viability of these activities in the area.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.

The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic.
 
The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms.
 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience.
 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.  It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.

Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt the local communities.

The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.

Please do not allow this project to move forward.

I am a lifelong resident of New York State, born and raised in Poughkeepsie, NY and currently living in Queens. I grew up camping in the shadows of the Catskills and the Adirondacks, and because of the public health crisis, I was fortunate enough to spend a significant period of time in the Catskills enjoying the great outdoors and spending much needed money in the local economy at small businesses and in the hospitality industry, which has suffered greatly due to the pandemic. I write today to express my dismay and opposition to the proposed Ashokan dam, docket P-15056. This plan, submitted by a west coast energy company, threatens the local economy and ecosystem of the Catskills. It will obstruct views, damage hiking trails, force road closures to valuable recreational areas and impact NYC’s drinking water. Historically, the Catskills was a summertime retreat for NYC residents back when people used the word “summer” as a verb. Over the years, as air travel became more popular and affordable, the Catskills fell out of favor and communities became blighted. That began to change recently, and with the influx of New Yorkers seeking a natural respite to their quarantined lives, communities are beginning to thrive again. This plan would erase that progress by discouraging continued tourism after the pandemic and threatening ski resorts. This plan, submitted with NO input from local regulators or stakeholders, will relegate burgeoning towns back to poverty and squalor. It will force naturalists into other areas like the Poconos and the Berkshires, pumping money into the economies of neighboring states instead of New York while profits from the project are enjoyed in California. The project will have negative environmental consequences as well. It will invite invasive species and interrupt fish breeding grounds. It will require clearing out sensitive vegetation. These are negative impacts that have long-term consequences on the environment. The positive impacts of this proposal are largely going to people in California while New Yorkers are left with an industrial plant ruining a nature preserve so important to our state that it was written into our constitution. New York has suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic. Many people left New York and will not return. The long-term impact of the pandemic is that people will be able to live anywhere they chose because they’re not tied to physical offices. Employment opportunities will no longer suffice to attract people to live in New York, and our tax base will shrink as a result. So will our numerical power in future censuses. If we want to keep New Yorkers in the state and continue to entice residents to spend locally, we must maintain local resources and recreation areas. I urge you to deny this project and preserve America’s First Forest for generations to come.</pre><hr><b>Comment of Michael Ogushwitz in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Michael Ogushwitz, Bloomfield, NJ.

I am writing in response to the flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it poses an unacceptable risk to the disruption New York City’s drinking water. 

I have heard the concerns of some folks about the possibility of enhanced water column turbidity from this proposed project, but my concern is with the potential of nutrient loading that has the potential to stimulate the outbreak of harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Given that New York City receives 40% of its water from the Ashokan Reservoir, it is imperative that the “Precautionary Principle” be invoked in this case.  Given the extreme catastrophic outcome should the waters Ashokan Reservoir become poisoned with HAB bloom toxins, the developer should be required to prove “with an extreme certainty” that HAB outbreaks would never occur.  This is a tall hurdle for the developer, but absolutely required in this case.  The HAB outbreak in the waters feeding Toledo Ohio in 2014 provides a clear word of caution for what HAB toxins can do to a public waterworks that serves a large metropolitan city.

Given the likelihood that the volume of upper reservoir will vary dramatically on a diel basis, it seems possible that in addition to resuspending bottom sediments, the process might also resuspend plant nutrients.  HABs, and associated toxins, could subsequently develop in the upper reservoir and be sent to the Ashokan and/or the suspended plant nutrients could be sent down to the Ashokan Reservoir, to stimulate HAB outbreaks directly.  This issue needs to be seriously addressed in my opinion.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear FERC:

	I am writing in regards to docket P-15056. Please do not approve Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California’s proposed pumped hydroelectric facility within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Reserve as it would have negative impacts on the Ashokan Reservoir and the surrounding area.

	The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and should be kept protected. This project endangers the water supply of NYC, would ruin the beautiful experience of visiting the area leading to a loss of tourist and business revenue for the nearby communities, and open the area to the unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction. These are but a few of the foreseen problems with such a massive construction project in this beautiful area. 

	I had the pleasure of walking the Ashokan Trail for the first time last fall with a friend. It was beautiful, and to think it might be threatened is disconcerting, to say the least. There were so many people walking the trail, enjoying the beautiful day in a beautiful setting. 

	Please do not say yes to Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California. New York State does not deserve this. 

	Thank you for your attention.

Docket P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose

I am John O&#39;Connell. I have lived at 945 Woodland Valley Road, Phoenicia since July, 1977.

I am writing to you to urge you to reject the deeply flawed proposal submitted by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains.

First, may I quote Victor Rojas, the President of Premium Energy, whose firm has submitted this flawed proposal

&#34;The Ashokan project will be built only with the cooperation of the community. We don’t want to harm or damage nothing or no one. It looks like the first choice of upper reservoir was a bad choice. There is a community in that location. This site alternative therefore will not be any longer pursue it.&#34; 

&#34;Also, since this reservoir belongs to the city of New York, if the city of New York deems this project not safe for the integrity of the water supply to the City, this project will not happen. Nothing will be done without the consensus of all stakeholders.&#34;

As of this moment there has been no communication with stakeholders. NONE

Technically I urge that the project must be rejected because

1. The proposed site is on designated Status 1 land, and federal policy explicitly directs that Status 1 and 2 land areas are highly protected and must be avoided for development. This proposal would demand a Constitutional Amendment passed by the NYS Legislature and signed by the Governor. This barrier alone is sufficient to stop the proposal, in its tracks, at this very moment.

2.The proposed project will severely disrupt and increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding streams, which serve as a primary source of unfiltered drinking water for 9 million New York residents.

3. The flawed application misrepresents its project as a “closed loop” design. In truth, it is an “add-on” design with worse environmental impacts.

4.The project raises numerous legal issues regarding States’ rights and land reservation.

5. The proposed site is home to protected species of wildlife and flora/fauna, as well as historical and cultural artifacts and sites.

We are keenly aware that officials charged with reviewing proposals consider the NIMBY issues raised by going forward. In reply I would note that this project has a highly negative impact not only on the people, wildlife and organizations in Catskill region, but also the 9 million residents of New York City. The Ashokan reservoir is the source of 40% of NYC drinking into water.

Additionally, comments from Premium Energy&#39;s Leadership, noted above, demonstrate that the Company, itself, has seriously erred in their proposal development by presenting a plan that even they admit is faulty.  

We clearly recognize the need for our nation and world to transition to green-energy sources. However, it is clear that this proposed effort is not a green-energy effort. It will destroy important wilderness areas, negatively affect wildlife, contaminate local wells and septic systems, negatively impact the drinking water of 9 million New Yorkers.

I urge you, as a responsible public official, to reject the  Premium Energy Proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.    

John T. O&#39;Connell</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ruth MI Bonapace under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ruth MI Bonapace, Lanesville, NY.
I own a home in Lanesville, Greene County, NY. The Stony Clove Creek intersects my property. I&#39;ve worked with DEP Stream Management since Hurricane Irene to rebuild   with state-of-the art energy efficiency and grading the land to mitigate flooding. Now, my home is &#34;ground zero&#34; in one of the three sites that could up under 40 feet of water.
   I oppose the proposed hydropower project currently under review by FERC (docket number P-15056) because:
    1. It will destroy my home and those of my neighbors, some of whom have lives in Lanesville for many generations. Even if I were to relocate, I would still oppose the project because:
    2. It will destroy The Stony Clove Creek, a popular fishing stream and a beautiful natural tributary feeding into the Esopus.
    3. It will negatively impact the area’s popular streams for fly fishing 
    4. It will cause economic harm to residents and businesses in Hunter and Phoenicia since State Route 214 - the only road between the two - would have to somehow be relocated.
    5. If Rt 214 is not relocated:
         -- All Hunter Ski resort traffic would come off Exit 20 of the Thruway instead of 19 (right now people use both) and cut through the already treacherous winding road around Kaaterskill Falls for skiing and summer cultural events. 
         -- The road past Kaaterskill is continually clogged with illegally parked cars and pedestrians in the summer and the additional traffic will bring the area to a crawl and could result in more pedestrian injuries or fatalities. 
         -- Skiers and hikers would be cut off from traveling between towns and businesses along the state-owned Rt 28 including the Belleayre ski area and Phoenicia and the Hunter/Tannersville/Windham areas. This will have a severe impact on the local economies of these areas.   
    Please do not let this private for-profit enterprise destroy our homes, communities, way of life and natural resources.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Stefan Hagen under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Stefan Hagen, New York, NY.
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.

Dear Kimberly D. Bose/FERC,

I am writing to state my resounding opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

In 2018, my husband and I moved from NYC to West Shokan to establish a new home for ourselves in the woods, as well as to create a DIY retreat space for future-focused creative practitioners where they could come to recharge in the beautiful, restorative Catskills. Our mission is to support regenerative work that centers the environment, and aims to bring about a greener, more equitable and more sustainable future. At this point, we’ve now hosted over 150 artists, engineers, journalists, social entrepreneurs, organizers, scientists, and others at our home—which is a beautiful space surrounded by the “forever-wild” Catskill Forest Preserve, a spring-fed pond, Wittenberg Brook, and Friday and Wittenberg Mountains.

Premium Energy’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would put a swift end to our work, as it would likely wipe our home and retreat space off the face of the earth—razing the forests we love, killing off many of the animals who call these forests home, and flooding this historic land, which was referred to by visitors of the 1900s as the “Eden of the Catskills.” 

While I would do almost anything to save our home, this is more than just a NIMBY plea. It is unimaginable to me to think that we could abandon our legally protected forests just because an opportunistic CA-based company sees these mountains and these waters as a cash cow. I assume FERC is smart enough to see this proposal for what it is—a plain-and-simple bad idea, with even worse execution—but of course I worry that the proposal will be taken seriously, despite its many flaws.

To me this project proposal screams, “Green energy, but at what cost?” Moving our state and country to renewable energy sources is a noble and worthy pursuit, for sure—but it shouldn’t be a game of addition by subtraction, where protected forests (also incredibly important for our green, eco-conscious future!) are sacrificed. We cannot justify that kind of irreversible devastation, at least not before other alternatives are fully investigated and pursued. Destroying any kind of protected land, and displacing communities—the very same communities that were devastated by the Ashokan Reservoir construction 120 years ago—should be an absolute last resort. Truly, we are not that desperate yet, and we have time to find better alternatives.

I believe in a future where green energy is abundant, and hydropower energy-storage solutions can be thoughtfully planned at sites that enrich and benefit their communities. Here, such a project would do nothing of the sort, and would instead be an abhorrent abomination, smashing through our community and this uniquely preserved land like a wrecking ball on fire. Nobody is asking for this, and it doesn’t even represent the kind of innovation needed for NYS to move to 70% renewables by 2030. The proposal is shoddy at best, strewn with false information to the point where it appears that whoever crafted it took a whack-a-mole approach, without doing due diligence to understand the actual landscape of the Ashokan watershed, or its highly preserved and protected status.

Best case, this project could be constructed with minimal damage to protected forests, and minimal sacrifice from our community. Even if this were the case, it still has major flaws that would continue to pose a threat far into the future. Perhaps the biggest of these threats is the risk it poses to the Ashokan Reservoir itself, and NYC’s unfiltered water supply, 40% of which comes from our watershed every day. As climate change continues to affect our weather patterns, who knows how the impending droughts and floods will affect the delicately balanced Ashokan. It would be downright careless to bring another vector of uncertainty into the equation, and using it as the lower reservoir for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would undoubtedly do just that, as the water supply becomes more and more unpredictable, murky, and turbid. We need to protect the valuable assets and resources we have, not needlessly endanger them with ill-conceived development.

At this early point in the process, I have already spent many hours working with the newly formed Coalition to Save Catskills Preserve—a hundreds-strong group of neighbors and organizations taking action against this horrid project. We are extremely aware of the flaws with Premium Energy’s proposal, we are organized, and we will be watching FERC’s process with eagle eyes, ready to pounce and fight to protect these lands, their wild inhabitants, and the homes of our families, neighbors, and friends. 

Now is the time to stop this proposal, before it’s allowed to wreak further havoc on our community, which has been thrown into an absolute furor over the mere idea of such a poorly thought-through project desecrating our beloved Catskills. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Thanks for your time.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose, 

I am writing about Premium Energy Holdings’s proposal regarding the hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Mountains using the Ashokan reservoir. I know that very few people want a project like this in their own neighborhood and I do not wish to add another of those voices just for the sake of preserving our own backyards. I believe that these projects are important. However, two of the issues raised have also concerned me enough that I feel compelled to add my voice. First, our area’s status as a forest preserve and designation as Status 1 land. I believe this corroborates the idea that these lands are particularly important to preserve and are likely to not be the best fit for a project such as this proposal. Second, the concerns related to the project not actually being “closed-loop” as they claim. In part because I do actually believe in the importance of these projects, please let us hold the companies accountable to do them correctly and as the agencies and offices involved require for good reason. 

Thank you very much for your time.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. This proposal is profoundly problematic and I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. The project, if completed, would negatively impact tourism, local communities, the area’s environment, and New York City’s drinking water.

Firstly, the project would be deeply damaging to local communities in the Catskills. Completion of the project would require the seizure of homes and private property via eminent domain, and displaced residents would likely have a challenging time finding affordable housing in the area. Ulster County is experiencing a severe housing shortage and the properties that are available are extremely expensive. Furthermore, many in the area are already struggling with loss of income due to the pandemic.

In addition to the potential problem of displacement the project would create, it is also important to consider the project’s deleterious effect on tourism in the Catskills. In 2019, tourism generated 17% of the employment in the region; it is a $1.6 billion industry which supports approximately 20,000 jobs. The Catskill region is justly celebrated as a haven for hikers, fishermen, and skiers. Premium Energy’s project would cut off access to these and other forms of recreation. Furthermore, the project would irreparably damage the area’s natural beauty. With a decrease in tourism, businesses and workers in Ulster County would suffer. 

Premium Energy’s project would also cause lasting harm to the environment. Large, unbroken areas of wildlife habitat are, sadly, now rare in our country: the Catskill Forest Preserve comprises almost 700,000 acres of contiguous habitat, and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats in the region, per the New York State Forest Condition Index. In addition, Catskill Forest Preserve lands, under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, are clearly designated as “forever. . .  wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Please do not allow this very special place to be altered beyond repair by Premium Energy.

Finally, Premium Energy’s project is an immediate and serious threat to New York City’s drinking water. The project would make use of the already-existing Ashokan Reservoir, which serves the city and which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, providing 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. In the 1990s alone, $1.7 billion was invested in the reservoir. It would be foolish and dangerous to endanger this essential resource in the ways that Premium Energy’s project would do. Their proposed pumped storage plant would adversely affect the sediment regime in tributary rivers and streams that feed the reservoir—ultimately harming not only the fish and wildlife that depend on them but also the many, many New York City residents who do as well.

I want to be clear that I am in favor of renewable energy, and that I hope it will play a large part in our transition away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable sources. However, we cannot sacrifice community and environmental well-being in pursuit of this goal, and the Premium Energy project would do just that. Though Premium Energy claims their project is a “closed loop,” a type of pumped storage project that would have a smaller impact on the surrounding ecosystem, this is false: the project is in fact an “add on” since it would use an existing body of water, the Ashokan, as a lower reservoir. In putting the project forward as a “closed loop,” Premium Energy has already lied to us. How can we trust them to maintain high standards and care for the community if they have based their proposal on an enormous falsehood?

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Reference:  Docket  # P-15056-000
Premium Energy Holdings, LLC has submitted a proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)  referred to as the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project  that seeks permission to do a feasibility study that would clarify the project’s scope and viability. In the proposal they call it a closed-loop project as such designs  are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.  
Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects, that’s what this really is. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project  therefore is not a closed-loop system.
 “Initial construction impacts” for these projects are lower, but operational impacts are likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the addon project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.”*

Here are a few reasons why this is a bad idea, and why people around the area dont want this to happen - 

1 - This is preserved land.  I didn&#39;t move into the middle of the mountains to have  a hydro electric plant ruining the ambiance.  its a state park preserve.  It should be kept that way.  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

2 - If you do move forward with this - the changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves are of the Catskills must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.

3 - This will impact the NYC water supply as its about 40% of the water it receives.  If a hydro electric power station is developed NYC residents may not be able to get the supplies they need

4 - Tourism and parks land generates 17% of the regions employment.  I for one would not want to go to a state park and see an ugly power supply station.  without the tourist - there isnt a reason to have these people employed.  

5 - This is an add on project and not a closed loop project.  The environmental impact of this could be HUGE.  Stating that the project is closed loop is just incorrect.  Please see plans and their own provided materials as to why this is an add on project.

Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources. Our transition must be built on an ethical approach, in this time many will come and try to reap the benefits of claiming their projects are clean, but the reality is the proposal from Premium Energy will do greater damage to the nature carbon sinks of the Catskills then its storage pumps could ever help to subvert.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

It has come to my attention that a California company, Premium Energy, has filed for a permit to create a hydroelectric power plant on the Ashokan Reservoir property. Within this proposal are 3 different site proposals for an upper reservoir (only one will be chosen). One of these sites is in Woodland Valley. The fact that they would be making a dam at the bottom of a dead end road would impact and flood residential neighborhoods, roads, delicate watersheds, NYC drinking water, recreation, trout spawning streams and the flow of traffic on a very narrow road with big trucks, polluting a pristine nature preserve and the Catskills State Park at the end of the road.

As a member of the Woodland Valley association and a citizen volunteering in Cornell Extension&#39;s program to monitor and eradicate invasive species along the stream, I oppose this short-sighted plan that will have a significant adverse impact on the eco-system, permanently altering the natural setting, water quality, public lands, wildlife and communities.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Zac Schiff under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to you, urging you and your team at FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the place I call home. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is incredibly flawed. Bringing this to life would mean destroying an ecosystem, disrupting local communities, and risking the purity of NYC’s drinking water. This idea is not worth the negative long-term cost.

Here’s a bulleted list as to why this idea is flawed:

•	Catskill Forest Preserve, wildlife and ecosystem are at risk of being tampered with. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat. It would be a complete shame to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
•	Pumped storage wreaks havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats. My home is part of the Ashokan watershed and I know how delicate the ecosystem is. Without a doubt of the rough water continuously moving up and doing that it would impair the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries.
•	The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people.
•	Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities, which I am a part of. This project would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are not affordable for those that are displaced. 
•	The proposed project would effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 
•	The project would impair the connectedness of Rt. 214 between Ulster and Green counties, impacting skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

I could outline many more reasons, but overall, this project will directly hurt the environment, my local community and even tourism. Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000.

Re:  Docket Number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing regarding the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  I have lived in Woodland Valley for 25 years and own a small home here.  My son attended the Phoenicia elementary school, and the Onteora middle/ high school in Boiceville.

Phoenicia is a lovely town and is becoming more and more popular as a tourist destination.  Woodland Valley is an integral part of the Phoenicia community, and the trails and campground located here are an important draw to the area.  It would be devastating to the residents here and damaging to the local economy if this project were to happen here.
As part of the Catskill Park, we prioritize maintaining the natural area that we live in, and the habitat we provide for wild animals.  This is part of what draws people here, and it would be endangered by the proposed project.

The larger community we are part of, the Onteora School District, suffered a great trauma when the community of Olive was destroyed to build the Ashokan Reservoir.  That harm has had long-lasting effects on our community and should not be repeated.

It is unclear to me at this moment whether I would lose my home should this project be approved, but it is clear that many of my neighbors would.  It is important for you to understand from the outset that the members of this community will unite in strong opposition to this project and do whatever we can to stop it.

Thank you for your consideration of our concerns,

I am dismayed and distressed to learn that my town and the site of my home is being considered for a hydroelectric plant. Not only am I concerned as a homeowner who would  lose their home, in the event I did not lose my home I am concerned as a mother of a young child as I do not know what the impact of being so near such a plant would be. I am further concerned since I spend time in New York City and count on having clean drinking water which comes from Lanesville watershed. I cannot imagine it is a plant would be safe for the city water which I also count on. Additionally, I travel  Route 214 daily and cannot imagine being cut off from the rest of the world were this plant to destroy my means of travel.  Not to mention the economic impact on this region which relies on tourists who travel the scenic route from Phoenicia and Woodstock to skiing at Hunter. Finally, my neighbors have owned their homes some of them for decades some for centuries and I can’t imagine where they will go. They depend on the forest for logging or they depend on route 214 to connect them with the ski mountain where most of the economy is focused. To cut off this route would be unspeakably detrimental. With the value of property has raised so much in the last year there is no place else for people to live. I personally have poured my savings into my house and cannot imagine I could find anything comparable that I could afford given the current market. I am troubled and disgusted by the larger environmental impacts such a project would have especially when our community would reap none of the benefits since the electricity would be shipped to Orange County. I think even a proposal of putting the plant here is shameful and incredibly shortsighted.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jonathan Nedbor under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am moved to write this in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I strongly urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
I have lived and hiked in this area for 40 years. In those 40 years I have seen endless proposals for projects that benefit those who do not live here in the Catskills. Projects that would spoil the natural beauty, disrupt the lives of local people, put our streams and creeks at risk and offer no long term benefits for the land or for those of us whose lives are here. 
I am sure that you are aware of the history of the Catskills Forest Preserve in Ulster County, created in 1885. And that under ArIcle XIV of the NYS ConsItuIon, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
 The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

I am sure that you are aware that as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. 
As for the environmental impacts on this area, it is known that these pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. As it is, we are now suffering from the releases from the Ashokan Reservoir into the Esopus Creek. These releases are laden with silt, smothering every living thing found in the creek with a dense layer of mud. Do we need more of this in this region? I do not think so, coffee colored streams and creeks, that are both unsightly and unhealthy. 
These additional releases will alter the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus as well as the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the NYC water supply system. This also puts further strain on the NYC water system which is unable to manage the silt problem as it stands at this time. This puts our streams at greater risk as well as the water system for all of New York City.
Chocolate brown streams, loss of fish habitat, damage to the environment, removal of acres of trees, construction, etc., will damage the local businesses that depend on the resources in the area as well as much needed tourism. 
I don’t think I need to add more to this letter, the concerns I have mentioned already should be enough of an argument to stop this mega project before it goes any further. It is poorly designed with no thought for the damage and destruction it will cause to the environment and to the inhabitants of this region.

Jonathan Nedbor</pre><hr><b>Comments of Blake Macko under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Blake Macko, Philadelphia, PA.

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water. There are many of us who are ready to put up a fight for all that stands to be destroyed by this project.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof.

MOTION TO INTERVENE of Michelle Friedel for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056

Dear Secretary Bose,

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Therefore, Michelle Friedel is filing a motion to be an intervenor and meet the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations to grant them full party status.

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project which encompasses the  private property where one of the proposed site projects would be located- Wittenberg Reservoir/Dam. Hence, Michelle Friedel along with her children will lose and not have access to their land as well as to their home which leads them to have substantial interest in the matter, since the property is their primary residence which is located on 55 Friedel Drive that is directly off  Moonhaw Road, West Shokan, NY 12494. 

Michelle Friedel respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Respectfully,

I write to ask that you deny PEH’s proposed project to construct a pumped-storage facility on Ashokan reservoir.  I am a fisherman who fishes the Esopus and its tributaries.  I recognize the need for energy storage alternatives, including pumped-storage.  Adequate capacity to store energy generated by renewable, but intermitted, sources like wind and solar, makes alternative energy sources more economically viable.   A project on the scale proposed by PEH , however, is incompatible with the Catskill region.  It would raise significant legal issues, would disrupt an ecosystem that has been protected for over a century, and would endanger a vital source of drinking water for millions of people.   I urge you to reject PEH’s proposal.  
Catskill Park lies within the “blue line” of protected lands designated as “forever wild” under the New York State constitution.  Before the turn of the last century, New York State wisely set aside certain areas of state forest land from industrial and large-scale commercial development as part of the state constitution.  NYS Const. Art. XIV.  The PEH project would require a taking under eminent domain.  Assuming its permit application were granted, a threshold issue PEH will face is whether such a taking is legally possible.  In a case involving a FERC certificate issued under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that under the Eleventh Amendment a state’s sovereign immunity prevents a private party from forcing the state into court to enforce a condemnation order to seize state land.  In re PennEast Pipeline Co., 938 F.3d 96 (3d Cir. 2019).  The Supreme Court has granted certiorari and will hear arguments this month.  But even if the Court overturns the Third Circuit, this can only resolve the threshold issue whether the courts will even hear the case and not whether the pipeline owner will prevail.  The proposed “taking” by PEH would be much more extensive than simply providing a right of way for a pipeline across state land at issue in PennEast.  More importantly, PEH would need to condemn land protected under a state constitution which may raise a host of constitutional issues.  
Construction of the facility is incompatible with largely undisturbed forest preserve provided by the Catskills Park.  Based on PEH’s First Amended Permit, any of the three proposals would require the delivery of many thousands of tons of concrete and steel through the park to construct the impoundment dams, tunnel s and halls for turbines and transformers.  More than 100 million cubic feet of rock and soil will need to be excavated and transported out of the park.  With the exception of the construction of New York City’s water reservoirs, no construction on this scale has occurred within the Catskills.  
Operation of the facility would have a significant impact on protected waterways.  PEH seeks to minimize the impact of the project by asserting that it is “closed loop.” See PEH First Amended Application at 11. If it were, PEH could take advantage of FERC’s expedited licensing process.  But PEH’s assertion is simply untrue.  A “closed-loop” facility is one that would  “(i) Cause little to no change to existing surface and groundwater flows and uses; (ii) Is unlikely to adversely affect species listed as a threatened species or endangered species, or designated critical habitat of such species, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; (iii) Utilize only reservoirs situated at locations other than natural waterways, lakes, wetlands, and other natural surface water features; and (iv) Rely only on temporary withdrawals from surface waters or groundwater for the sole purposes of initial fill and periodic recharge needed for project operation.”   18 C.F.R. § 7.1(c)(3).  Operation of the PEH facility would degrade the aquatic ecosystem of the Esopus, which is a “natural waterway” that was impounded to create the Ashokan.  Water flows into and the out from the Ashokan making PEH’s project an “open-loop” system unlike, for example, the proposed Goldendale Energy Storage Project which would use specially constructed embankments to form a truly “closed-loop.”  See Federal Register 2017, 82 FR 60593 FFP Project 101 .  The proposed PEH facility will no doubt change groundwater flows, eliminating at least one tributary to the Esopus.  It remains to be seen what species may be impacted by operation the project, but the proposal cannot be considered one a closed loop that minimizes environmental impacts.  
Operation of PEH’s facility will also endanger the water supply for millions.  The Ashokan is the largest reservoir in the NYC water supply system.  By maintaining an undisturbed watershed around its reservoirs, New York City has created a water supply that is the envy of every major city on the planet.  Even so, silt has been an issue for the Ashokan.  For over 100 years, the West Basin has served as a settling pond for water from the Esopus and from City reservoirs further upstate; silt drops from suspension before flowing over a weir into the East Basin where the City’s intake port is located.  A study of water years from 2010 to 2012 found between 30,000 and 600,000 tons of silt flowed into the West Basin annually.  Even assuming the average year’s silt load is 100,000 tons per year, after 100 years of operation there are 10 million tons of silt resting on the bottom of the West Basin.  PEH estimates it will pump 15,800 acre-ft of water into and out from the West Basin on a daily basis.  Disturbance of the West Basin will no doubt resuspend accumulated silt and will impact the ability of the West basis to absorb incoming silt.  
The protected lands within the Catskill blue line are a wise investment New York State made on behalf of its citizens. In seeking to achieve the laudable goals of affordable, reliable, clean energy, FERC should not squander this investment.  I urge you to reject PEH’s proposed project in the Catskills.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Sarah Kinlaw under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Kimberly Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, extremely disruptive to local communities, an unwise decision for the environment, with potentially awful implications on the purity if the drinking water in New York City.

The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country. While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats because, within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

Sarah Kinlaw</pre><hr><b>Comments of Irwin Marcus under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Irwin Marcus, Boiceville, NY.
This Premium Energy project is ill conceived and unwelcome in a pristine environmentally protected water shed area. I am to believe that this project was supposed to act as a battery to provide ‘peak’ electric supply rather than increase our overall power generated.

The electrical generation of hydro-pumped storage consumes more electricity than it produces.

The money would be better spent to augment our areas’ electrical needs by using solar, wind and run-of-river hydro power.

For battery type storage – the current technology such as the Tesla Megapack can provide Megawatts of electricity for peak use in the future. The price for battery storage will decrease dramatically in the near future and the next wave of 80% reclaimed electric auto batteries can be used to increase storage capacity and at a lower cost.

So my question is why are we using such a destructive pumped hydro solution when we don’t have a problem at this time – if you say we have a peak issue – then please tell me what is our area’s current electrical drain during a 24 hour period and what do we need to provide peak power overload for now and for the next 5 – 10 years? 

An issue as far as the system proposed is ‘Not a Closed Loop’ system.
The proposal states falsely in Exhibit 1 on p. 11: &#34;The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would operate in a closed loop. This is NOT a closed-loop system. It is an ‘add-on’ project for open-loop pumped-storage hydropower because the proposed project’s lower reservoir, Ashokan Reservoir, is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed to construct the Ashokan Reservoir

The three sites proposed for the upper reservoir would cause major damage to highly preserved land in the Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County.

Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.
The proposed project would destroy these irreplaceable natural areas, undermine the attractiveness of the area for tourism, weaken the local economy, pollute downstream, and probably wreck one of NYC&#39;s major capital assets, its water supply system.
Also – the Forest Preserve shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 2 land under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.&#34; 

In conclusion, granting the urgent need for more renewable energy in New York State and nationally, this preliminary permit application should be rejected at the outset, because the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding forests and mountains are not the right place for this project.

The amount of digging and construction in the fragile area proposed would permanently dislodge wildlife, the flora and fauna and countless other forms of life.

Yours truly

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Heidi Emrich and I am a resident of West Shokan, NY in the Bushkill / Maltby Hollow / Whittenburg Stream neighborhood.  

Our recent discovery of the proposed Pump Project (FERC Project NO. 15056-000) which includes the building of a dam in one of three regions in our beautiful Catskills and 13-17 miles of transmission line, has us EXTREMELY alarmed.  Folks live here because we enjoy a peaceful life in harmony with nature.  And while we recognize the need for renewable energy sources, damming up our streams is not an environmentally-sensitive solution.
 
There is significant research about the detrimental and irreversible effects of dams.

Our communities are FULL of critical environmental resources, wetlands ecosystems, rare habitats, threatened and endangered plants and wildlife.  Our communities are also full of active community members who frequent our parks, trails, local swimming holes and other recreational resources.  Our communities are also beautiful and thriving. Plain and Simple. Home sales are up, neighborhoods are growing and folks are investing time and money into restoring our beautiful rural heritage. 

In addition to environmental concerns and impacts of dam-building, our family is terrified of the possibility of large transmission lines running through our front or back yard. Our home is RIGHT in line with one of the proposed models. We have not invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our home and landscaping improvements, all to see our property value decreased. 

Please listen to the community. The Town of Olive Residents do NOT want this, we don&#39;t need it. We haven&#39;t commissioned it. In fact, we didn&#39;t even know about it until late February!? How can a company from California come in and even propose such a project that the Community/County isn&#39;t asking for/commissioning?  This company is obviously in the business of making money- and they looked at some topographic and hydrogeological maps and picked us to be their guinea pigs.  

Everyone is scared this will steamroll its way in and our voices won’t be heard and our landscape will be forever changed.

  As a long time resident of Lanesville NY and owner of a local business I would like to submit my vigorous opposition to the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. I am a strong advocate for renewable energy projects, however   the Catskill locations proposed are untenable.
  All the proposed sites fall within the Catskill Forest Preserve, which according to the NYS constitution “ shall be forever kept wild forest”. Usurping this caveat would require a constitutional amendment that is rarely passed. The original amendment was initiated to protect this precious land resource and should not be altered.  All the proposed sites fall within the Status 1 designation under the USGS Gap Analysis Program, which voids development according to the Department of Energy’s “Hydropower Vision”.
  The project would adversely affect the streams and waterways by increasing turbidity.  The streams are already fragile and any further development threatens the local ecology and fauna.  Recreational fishing is a prime attraction for this area and helps the local economy flourish. The project jeopardizes trout breeding grounds and falls within the  “ Audubon’s Catskill Peak Important Bird Area”. We cannot afford to threaten these resources. The turbidity also puts at risk the quality of the drinking water that serves 9 million residents of NYC. 
  The proposed site intersecting Route 214 in Lanesville is a designated “scenic byway” and a primary thoroughfare connecting difficult to access portions of the mountains.  Disrupting or voiding this passage   would increase travel times up to an hour and adversely affect the tourism economy of the town.
  The proposal by Premium Energy classifies the project as a closed loop system. This is misleading at best and deceitful at worst. The project is an add- on system with a much stronger environmental impact.  The affect on the existing reservoir could be extremely detrimental. 
  All the local municipalities are strongly opposed to this project.  Given the environmental and economic impact and political and legal hurdles to overcome… this project should be stopped in its tracks before further investments make it more difficult to halt.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Angelina Vezzetti under P-15056.

Subject: FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA
To Secretary Kimberly D. Bose:
My opposition to the proposed project by Premium Energy is made on the following basis. First and foremost, Section 1 of Article XIV of the New York State Constitution makes such a proposal within the Catskill Park Preserve unconstitutional. “Section 1. The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.” There are these facts to also consider:
•	It would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
•	It would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents.
•	There is really no reason for it other than the fact that some spineless energy executives from California are trying to generate revenue where my family has spent our lives fishing, camping, and hiking. 
•	Apologies for my language but it is also a fact that Premium Energy can absolutely fuck right off with their assertion that this is a “closed loop” project and will not have significant environmental impacts. We are not stupid.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056-000 as it would be devastating to the environment and highly disruptive to local communities. In a pandemic world, this is of no small matter. We need to preserve critical infrastructure, jobs, and environmental havens.

Tourism is an integral part of the NYS economy and continues to grow. Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019. A $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs o Ulster County represents 43% of that market o Second homes generate $360 million in economic activity. Source: Tourism Economics, “Economic Impact of Tourism in NY, 2019”

The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” According to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line-Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.

Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago.

This is not the innovation that Department of Energy would want. Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval; that’s why Premium is claiming to be “closed loop.” Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects; that is what this really is. Premium Energy Holdings is grievously misrepresenting the facts.

Have we not learned our lessons from the past? Can we not seek a more suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources?
Looking at all the facts and negative impacts, it would be irresponsible to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

Please do the right thing, listen to the collective voices of those most impacted by this decision and the generations to follow, and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Secretary Bose: 

These comments are submitted on behalf of the Mid Hudson Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a member of the New York State Council of Trout Unlimited. Our chapter has more than three hundred members. Roughly seventy-five percent of all of our members recreate in the Esopus Creek watershed. 

Ashokan Reservoir is part of New York City’s water supply system, meeting approximately forty percent of NYC’s water needs. It is the oldest of NYC’s six Catskill water supply impoundments, and the second largest. Since its construction in 1915, over one hundred years of sedimentation have settled in the west basin, where Premium Energy Holdings seeks to construct a pumped storage facility. To date, water utilized by NYC residents remains unfiltered. If a pumped storage project is built on the Ashokan, there is every reason to believe that turbidity would be created by the pumping and releasing of water from and into the Ashokan. 

In a similar request before FERC for a license to construct a pumped storage project on NYC’s Schoharie Reservoir at Prattsville, Project # 2729, New York City retained Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory as a consultant. On page 12 of a report produced by NYC’s consultant it noted that such the operation of such could “create an unacceptable human health risk.” Furthermore, appropriately twenty municipalities draw water from NYC’s Catskill aqueduct as water is transferred downstate to NYC residents. These users would be placed at risk also. To further exacerbate this condition, during summer months, on most typical water years, up to ninety percent of the water in the Esopus Creek comes from water being diverted to the Ashokan via NYC’s Shandaken Tunnel. Often during these periods this water tends to be turbid. Hence, the operation of a pump storage facility on the Ashokan will only keep silt suspended in the water column that much longer. 

The Ashokan Reservoir currently is a two-story reservoir, that is, it stratifies into warm and cold-water sections throughout the year. As such, it supports a robust population of wild rainbow and brown trout in the cold-water portion. This provides sport fishing within the reservoir, which is an economic draw to recreational based Ulster County economy, and also a source of recruitment for the renowned Esopus Creek trout fishery. 

Recently the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation reclassified the Esopus Creek as a Wild-Quality stream, under their newly approved Trout Management Plan. This will benefit both the environment, plus the local economy as anglers come. Trout Unlimited conducted two “Heritage Brook Trout Studies”, in portions of the watershed that could be adversely affected by this proposal. Fin samples of brook trout were taken, and their DNA was analyzed by Dr. Spencer Bruce, of the University at Albany. Dr. Bruce is noted for his work in this field. In 2019 in West Shokan, on South Hollow, Dr. Bruce concluded from data collected that the brook trout were a unique Heritage strain. This tributary is in close proximity to Wittenberg, where one might conclude brook trout there are likewise also. In 2020 we studied a tributary in Stony Clove. Due to Covid, analysis of these fish samples has been delayed, but our chapter expects similar results. This study was done in partnership with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Region 3 Fisheries as part of their ongoing Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture studies. It is possible the headwaters of all three alternative sites support Heritage brook trout populations, that would be lost should this project be allowed. 

There are serious issues with how this proposal will affect the New York State Forest Preserve lands and their established, protected uses for the people of New York. Noted issues with this proposal will negatively impact drinking water quality, the environment, economy, NYS constitution protecting the Catskill Forest Preserve, and well-being of people living in the area of the P-15056. We believe these issues outweigh any potential benefits of the project. The applicant has not established a clearly defined need for such a project. Therefore, we respectfully request that FERC deny approval.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve MUST NOT be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. Thank you.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to express my sincere concern about the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. It is my deepest hope that FERC will decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While I understand the need for renewable energy and support the goal to get to Net Zero by 2050 nationally, this goal cannot be achieved at the expense of natural habitat. As you may know, the Catskill Forest Preserve is home to many year-round and seasonal native wild species. I write to you now from the beginning of spring migration; I&#39;ve already enjoyed the return of Tree Swallows and look forward to seeing Hooded Warblers and other migratory visitors in my yard soon. My home is mere steps away from the Esopus Creek so the land that surrounds us is well suited to sustain wildlife, and it must remain so. This project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. 

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

And I understand why it was protected. The Catskill Forest Preserve is a special place for those of us lucky enough to live here as well as for visitors who recreate here year round. In fact, Catskills’ growing tourism economy generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. 

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to the communities built and maintained by those of us who live here. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. When I watched a documentary about that project I thought, “That would never happen today.” Please don’t prove me wrong.  

It must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.

Hello, I am writing to share my concerns about the plan with Premium Energy Holdings to erect a hydroelectric power plant. The Catskill Mountains are a critical habitat that must be protected from this kind of disruption. As a NY taxpayer and frequent visitor to the Catskills (and surrounding businesses) this change is alarming to me personally, as well as to my sense of communal wellbeing. 

Green energy is an crucial goal, but doing so in a way that further harms the environment and community is not a step forward, but a step back—and one that sets a precedent for further harm.

Docket #P-15056

The proposed pumped storage hydroelectricity facility in the Catskills is immediately on the boundaries of land protected by the &#34;Forever Wild&#34; clause of the New York State Constitution, and will obviously have an adverse impact on those lands. More generally, the Catskill park is one giant gem, no part of which should be disturbed by such a project.

Moreover, pumped storage is an inefficient way to replace fossil fuels. Its benefit is that it levels demand, making it possible to avoid building new generating facilities. However, the existing generating facilities still require more energy to pump the water uphill. Even if that energy is clean, it could have gone directly to consumers.

Whether or not FERC has jurisdiction over this question, you must act in accordance with reality. Our environmental crisis will not be solved until the population stops growing. It is not sufficient to say that such a facility could be built elsewhere. If we don&#39;t halt population growth, the alternate, less-damaging locations will all be utilized, and the problem will still not be solved, because the population will still be growing. World population growth must be stopped, or civilization will collapse.

I would also like to know what part of our U.S. Constitution grants FERC jurisdiction over such a project as this to begin with. It&#39;s a local supplement to the power supply.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I respectfully urge FERC to decline this request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it has the very real potential to be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of New York City&#39;s drinking water.

I am a resident of West Shokan, New York. We are privileged in West Shokan to be surrounded by the beautiful Catskill Mountains, the Catskills Park, the Catskill Forest Preserve, the Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir. We are quite concerned by the application made by Premium Energy to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the vicinity of these resources, much of which is intended to be protected by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution: “The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private . . . .”
We are concerned that the construction and operation of the proposed facility will endanger the ecology of the Catskills Forest Preserve, including endangering threatened species. Construction and operation of the facility will also negatively impact recreational use of these natural resources by hikers, and by those who enjoy the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming, and, as a result, would undoubtedly have a negative impact on tourism, resultant business revenues and sorely needed local tax revenues. This area of the Catskills is just recently and slowly recovering from years of economic decline and proceeding with the proposed facility would be a major setback to these communities and its residents.

Also, construction and operation of Premium Energy’s hydroelectric facility in the vicinity of the Esopus Creek, which feeds directly into the Ashokan Reservoir, and in the vicinity of the Reservoir itself, cannot but increase turbidity and put at risk the quality of New York City’s drinking water. According to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, “[The] Ashokan Reservoir supplies about 40% of New York City’s daily drinking water needs in non-drought periods.&#34;

I do understand the need to develop alternative sources of energy. However, there must be areas where such alternative energy sources could be developed that are not adjacent to the source of critical water supplies for the City of New York and to the other protected resources of the Catskills, an area where construction and operation would not destroy protected wilderness, disrupt vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

I urge FERC to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Thank you.

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.
The legacy of the Ashokan displaced many families and farms in the interest of supplying NYC with a pristine water supply; to allow this to happen now is a profound breech of the promises made not only to the families who sacrificed much for the Catskill Watershed project, but also to the citizens of NYC who fought to get clean water from the mountains as opposed to the polluted and dangerous reservoirs in Manhattan and the incorporated boroughs.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Fran Melmed under P-15056.

I am writing in reference to docket P-15056, the Proposed pumped-storage hydro plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York State.  This proposal is problematic in any number of ways.  The Catskill land involved is a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and designated as either &#34;Forever Wild&#34; or &#34;Wildlands.&#34;  The construction of the proposed reservoirs will be environmentally destructive, as will the necessary additional powerlines involved.  Native flora and fauna will be severely impacted, and there will be an increased risk of the introduction of invasive species into this environmentally sensitive area. The project will significantly increase the turbidity of New York City&#39;s drinking water (increased turbidity is already a local concern with the reservoir&#39;s periodic releases into the Esopus Creek). The vital tourist economy of the area will be adversely affected, as will the citizens of the neighboring towns and villages.  It is difficult to believe that Premium Energy has done any preliminary investigation of the multiple, disqualifying issues surrounding this project.  I strongly urge that you reject this application.</pre><hr><b>Comments of John Ellingboe under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>John Ellingboe, New York, NY.
The pumped storage project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California near the Ashokan Reservoir is ill-conceived and should not be constructed within the boundaries of the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve. This proposed project would directly threaten the experience of trail users in the Catskill Forest Preserve, the ecological sustainability of the Forest Preserve, trout breeding grounds, and the quality of the New York City water supply. It seems that no local stakeholders were consulted before the proposal was submitted, and the nature of the area was not considered. Please do not allow this project to go forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of P Keusch under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>P Keusch, Los Angeles, CA.
I am a property owner on Stony Clove Lane in Chichester New York just off route 214 and am opposed to the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings (PEH) for the project to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant utilizing the Ashokan Reservoir (docket number P-15056).

I believe PEH’s proposal is filled with erroneous and misleading information, and oppose it for the following reasons:

The entire proposed project lies within the Catskill Forest Preserve, which has been protected in section 2.1 of the New York State Constitution since 1894.

Key players were not notified beforehand, as legally required, including:  New York City, The hamlets of Lanesville, Chichester, Phoenicia, Mt. Tremper, Towns of Shandaken, Olive and Hunter, Ulster and Greene counties, Hunter Mountain Ski Resort, and its parent company Vail Resorts

Local and vacationer traffic on New York State Route 214, connecting Hunter Mountain, and the hamlets of Tannersville and Hunter to all points south, would be severely disrupted, wreaking economic havoc on the affected hamlets, towns, and counties.

Replacing New York State Route 214 will prove impractical, if not impossible, given the topography of the land.

New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection operates the city’s drinking water supply under a Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) issued by the US Environmental Protection Administration. The proposed project would drastically raise the turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir watershed

As proposed, PEH’s project is not a closed loop system

With so much private property located within close proximity to the Stony Clove creek, and surrounded by the Catskill Forest Preserve, relocation of homes and businesses along the creek is impossible without amendment of the New York State Constitution.

I urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny Premium Energy Holdings the permit.

I would encourage you to deny this permit as although it is a renewable energy tactic the impact on the environment would be extremely detrimental. It will not only impact views and access to this NY State Preserve but will also negatively impact local wildlife and harm NYC water supply access.

Basis for Intervening:
Ulster County Planning Department: Reasons to Intervene

Overview of Department Responsibilities: The Ulster County Planning Department is a regional planning entity that exercises planning functions that include review and approval of land use projects, comprehensive plans and zoning statutes in the Project area.  In addition, the Department provides oversight and planning for housing, economic development, agriculture, and environmental protection.  The Project, as proposed, has the potential to have significant impacts across nearly all of the Department’s areas of responsibility.
  
The Department is also host agency for the Ulster County Transportation Council, a federally recognized Metropolitan Planning Organization that is responsible planning and programming the use of federal funds for transportation infrastructure within the Project area. Project construction may have significant impacts on the transportation infrastructure. Of particular concern is transporting large pieces of equipment over critical corridors as well as the impact on local roads and bridges. 

The Department is also a member of the Ulster County Water Quality Coordinating Committee and the Ashokan Release Working Group.  These entities have a responsibility for the protection of water quality in the Project area.   Specifically, the Department is currently engaged in commenting on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in relation to turbid discharges from the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir to the Lower Esopus Creek.  

The Project is proposing to utilize the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir as a lower reservoir. The West Basin is designed as a settling basin to capture and hold turbid water to allow the colloidal clays of the Catskills to settle out thereby protecting the City of New York’s Water Supply.  To further protect the water supply, discharges for operational and flood control purposes are made from the West Basin to the Lower Esopus. The operation of the pumped storage facility is highly likely to disrupt the normal settling pattern and timeframes in the West Basin of the Ashokan Reservoir and the length of the turbid discharges to the lower Esopus. These turbid discharges to the lower Esopus impact fish and wildlife, and economic opportunities along approximately 30 miles of the Creek.
  
It should be noted, that reduction in turbidity and improved flood control associated with the operation of the Ashokan Reservoir as it relates to the Lower Esopus Creek is subject to an order on consent by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.  In addition, the Catskill Turbidity Control Program (CTCP) is part of the Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD) issued by US EPA that allows New York City to avoid filtration of its water supply. This program initiated the use of the measures described above to ensure the protection of the City water supply.  The Project effects of increasing the length of time turbid water remains in the Ashokan Reservoir may alter the operational requirements under the CTCP and impact the public water supply systems located in Ulster County that draw water from the Ashokan Reservoir through the Catskill Aqueduct as well as those drawing water from the 
Current data suggests that turbid discharges to the Lower Esopus which drains to the Hudson River impact the drinking water filtration systems that draw water from the Hudson River requiring additional filtration costs.  The Project is likely to lengthen the amount of time that turbid water will be present and discharged to the Hudson River through the lower Esopus to impact these facilities.

The Ashokan Reservoir is an important recreational destination for Ulster County’s strong tourism based economy.  The County recently completed the Ashokan Rail Trail that has drawn over 200,000 visitors in its first year of operation.  In addition, recreational fishing is permitted on the Ashokan that includes the use of non-motorized boats.  Finally, significant important views of the Catskill are available at the Reservoir site.  The Project&#39;s impacts on these activities during construction and operation are unknown at this time. 

The Catskill Park where the Project is located is a refuge for many threatened and endangered species. Active acquisition by New York City to protect its water supply and regional and national environmental groups is ongoing within the Project area.  In addition, New York State continues to acquire lands in the area that are protected under the New York State Constitution as forever wild.  Various land use controls and practices exist to protect lands that remain in private ownership. The proposed locations for the upper reservoirs may encroach on these protected areas and even if they do not may significantly impact the ecosystems that exist in these areas of the Catskill Park. 

Wherefore, Dennis Doyle Director of the Ulster County Department of Planning, respectfully requests that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings.

Proposed Hydroelectric Plant at Ashokan Reservoir. 

This project is a terrible idea and should not be permitted to proceed for the following reasons:

The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution.
The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails.
The road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 
The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms. 
The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience. 
This plan would increase turbidity and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water.
It would cause a significant impact on the streams, affecting fishing, boating, and swimming.
Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Arthur Linker under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Arthur Linker, Scarsdale, NY.

Re: Project P-15056 Ashokan Pumped Storage 

Dear Secretary Bose:

I am writing FERC to express my strong opposition to the referenced proposal, plus hopefully providing this agency additional insights regarding it.

To begin with, this proposal is NOT a closed system, but part of New York City’s (NYC) watershed that contains an unfiltered water supply with various stream inflows and outflows, including the Catskill Adequate.  Thus, it is a living body of water that acts as an important source of drinking water for millions of New Yorkers, plus provides recreational opportunities that support the local economy.  I find it disheartening that the applicant, Premium Energy Holdings (PEH), didn’t understand this simple fact, or chose to mislead FERC.

Furthermore, when NYC constructed the Ashokan Reservoir in the early 1900s, it did so utilizing two separate basins, where the western reservoir--- primary location of this PEH proposal--- served as a settling basin for incoming, and sometimes turbid waters.  As part of an effort to avoid water filtration, NYC helped by underwriting costs of minimizing turbid inflows through funding the Ashokan Stream Management Program (AWSMP).  Per information available to the general public, and found online,

“The Ashokan Watershed Stream Management Program was established as a joint effort between Cornell Cooperative Extension of Ulster County (CCE), the Ulster County Soil and Water Conservation District (UCSWCD), and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The three agencies work collaboratively to protect and restore the stability and ecological integrity of streams in the Ashokan Reservoir Watershed. 

Action planning in the Ashokan Watershed began with the development of stream management plans for the Broadstreet Hollow Creek in 2003, Stony Clove Creek in 2004, the Upper Esopus Creek in 2007, and the Beaver Kill in 2015. In subsequent years, AWSMP completed stream assessments of Woodland Creek, Beaver Kill, Warner Creek, Birch Creek, Bush Kill, Bushnellsville Creek, and the Stony Clove Creek was reassessed. 

A Filtration Avoidance Declaration (FAD) granted to NYC in 2007 requires DEP and its partners to develop an Action Plan for the coming year to show how the findings and recommendations of the stream management plans will be implemented.”

Currently UCSWCD contributes twelve million dollars ($12,000,0000) over a rolling five-year period to this effort, of which 62% of this money is devoted to turbidity reduction restoration projects upstream of the Ashokan Reservoir.  This is a significant contribution committed to the reduction of turbid inflows to the Ashokan to protect the quality of the drinking water, which this proposal will adversely impact.

On a slightly different vein, there are some 300,000 annual visits yearly to the Ashokan Promenade along the reservoir, drawn by the beauty of the surroundings.  To be clear, not all of these visits are unique individual visitations, but include some return visitors.  Additionally, there are over 2000 registered rowboats of anglers who utilize the Ashokan for fishing purposes, and this does not include foot traffic of anglers from shore.  Plus, the newly implemented Ashokan Rail Trail (ART) has an estimated 250,000 annual visitors.  On a nice weather weekend parking space is often not available for all those who wish to use the ART.

This proposal is an economic and environmental disaster that flies in the face of all commonsense, directly and adversely impacting all those who benefit from NYC’s Ashokan Reservoir.  Pumping and release of water between two different reservoirs, varying the Ashokan’s levels will keep silt suspended in the water column causing significant, and potentially unhealthy issues with the City’s drinking water.  It will adversely impact the existing fishery, which has been an economic engine for a struggling local economy.  Plus, just the sight of the clean, majestic Ashokan Reservoir against the Catskill wild forest backdrop has brought crowds of anglers, walkers, bald-eagle watchers, nature lovers, and sight-seers who further support the local economy through purchases of gas, food, and gifts.  And this does not include the potential health and financial impacts to the nine million New Yorkers who rely upon the Ashokan Reservoir as a source of unfiltered drinking water.  This project is ill conceived with far reaching economic and environmental impacts.

For these reasons, I urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to deny a permit to Premium Energy Holdings for the referenced project.

Kimberly D. Bose
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First St. NE, Room 1A
Washington, D.C. 20426.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

First, and most importantly, residents of the Catskills have lived here for centuries. However, in recent years, we&#39;ve experienced a tremendous change regarding our waterways. Frequent hurricanes and heavy rainfall have led to flooding, and FEMA has re-zoned many of our homes. Our waterways are fragile. I cannot stress enough the importance of avoiding all unnecessary change that could directly change the volume of water flowing through our rivers and streams. 

Further, I support the points by SavetheCatskills:

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Rerouting Route 214 (a Scenic Byway) would be incredibly disruptive.
The loss of tourist dollars and business revenue would directly hurt our communities.
The plan could limit access to skiing/concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Alexander Archambault under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/6/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alexander Archambault, New York, NY.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I’m writing in opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as described, would be devastating to the environment, displace vibrant local communities, and threaten the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Why now would this pact be breached?

The area around the proposed plan is the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. Why would we destroy this vital land? Once it’s gone, we can never get it back. 

Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Sincerely,

My name is Sam Kalb, I come from Woodstock, NY, and I would like to express my strong opposition to Premium Energy Holdings&#39; Ashokan Pumped Storage project. I am an ecology graduate student and as I have delved into this field of research one point I have come to again and again is how lucky I am to be from the Catskills; very few places still exist in the world like our region. Infrastructure and urban sprawl are creating widespread pest ecosystems, systems where a small number of highly reproductive species dominate due to altered ecosystem processes such as nutrient dynamics. Streams impacted by dams are at extremely high risk for such a transformation; stream ecosystems rely heavily on natural flow regimes for maintaining microhabitats for many species that keep them diverse, and the unnatural uniformity created by dams can cause many of these species to go locally extinct. Large areas of still water are highly vulnerable to eutrophication, the process of nutrient overload that leads to the dreaded &#34;dead zones&#34; seen in regions like Lake Erie. 

I am not a pure preservationist who holds some idealistic worldview that humans should never do anything with negative ecological consequences, nor am I akin to Edward Wilson, the ecologist pushing to preserve 50% of the world&#39;s land from human use. I am a realist. What I want to impress upon our decision makers is that the Catskills region where this dam has been proposed is one of the last of a fast disappearing type of landscape, wildland where human communities exist around healthy ecological processes. Travel the United States with an ecologist and you will see just how rare such regions are in a country where urban sprawl is becoming a dominant land cover type. The Catskills represent a future where humans can extract resources from our environment in an ecologically conscious way. A Catskills region with this dam will not have the same character we so love now, and that is a guarantee. Among the proudest parts of being a New Yorker is that our state constitution protects such lands; if our elected leaders and their appointed agents fail to respect such protections, it becomes one more failing of a broad system of powers in which many young people like me are fast losing faith. I have had some faith that our new government may break this long trend of lost faith, and I hope you will prove me right by respecting both our state constitution and the value for a biosphere where humans can live in concert with nature.

The bottom line is this: energy can be acquired from many sources, but healthy forests and streams are a phenomenon that will not long persist if those in power allow projects like this. I would consider it a deep failing to allow the mountain forests that made me who I am to be turned into just one more low-biodiversity dammed watershed.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Samuel Kalb under P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.

This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

As a local resident who supports clean energy development as an essential part of our transition away from fossil fuels, I believe we should not immediately decide against a project such as the Ashokan pumped hydropower proposal without at least understanding both the costs and the benefits.  Premium Energy should be allowed to do its feasibility study, so that we can make a decision based on facts and evidence, and actually weigh the costs against the benefits.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Larry Federman under P-15056.

    On behalf of Northern Catskills Audubon Society, the 350-member chapter of the National Audubon Society, and whose chapter territory includes the area of this proposal, I offer these comments in opposition to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Energy Storage Project, Docket P-15056.
    The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area (IBA), identified by Audubon New York as one of the largest contiguous forest tracts in the state.  The area was given IBA designation due to the presence of high-elevation breeding bird species, such as Bicknell’s Thrush and Blackpoll Warbler, as well as home to the suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds.  Many of these are considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State, or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds. 
    Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species currently not identified as in need of protections.
    We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are needlessly spent, given that further, detailed negative environmental effects that will certainly be identified in an EIS if the project is approved to move to the next step.

To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in protest of the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for which  you have received a Preliminary Permit Application.  It is inconceivable that such a project has even been suggested for our quiet, pristine country location.  The effect of such an undertaking would completely change the character of our local communities and environs.

In the Town of Olive there is currently a civil ongoing discussion about just how the town should control development.  There is no doubt in my mind that if this project is approved the citizenry of Olive will be completely united in doing all that it can to prevent the first shovelful of rural earth to be disturbed. Many citizens of the Town of Olive are still smarting from the Ashokan Dam project which flooded and destroyed Olive City and Olivebridge.  That project was completed 115 years ago, yet remains a serious bone of contention in Olive. The proposed project brings the Ashokan Dam project to the minds of the citizens of Olive, New York.  Please deny the Preliminary Permit, help us preserve our communities and environment and make unneeded what is certain to be a powerful and universal objection to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Re: FERC docket number P-15056-000

To Whom It May Concern, 

     I am writing to express my strong opposition to Premium Energy Holdings, LLC’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As a lifelong resident of Woodland Valley, in Shandaken/Phoenicia, New York, I am deeply disturbed by the idea of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC turning my home into the proposed “Woodland Reservoir.” A California-based company, despite its good intentions of promoting renewable energy, cannot be allowed to enter a New York State-protected mountain preserve for the sole purpose of providing additional energy capacities. Not only would the proposed dam and reservoir increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed, thus drastically reducing quality levels for NYC’s primary water supply, but it would be devastating to our local communities and economy. Such proposed reservoirs will displace hundreds of residents by flooding/raising their homes. Although my own home is in the directly affected area, I am writing on behalf of my community and neighbors, many of whom settled here decades before I was born. 

     The Woodland Valley stream, which feeds into the broader Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir, is an ecologically diverse area that is home to protected species of fish, birds, plants, trees, and animals. I have spent countless days walking along its banks, swimming in its currents, and simply admiring its natural beauty. Over the past year, the Valley has been my place of respite from the ever-ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. These same qualities, stories, and uses are true of all three proposed site areas, and Premium Energy Holdings must recognize that their destruction is neither viable nor ethical. In 1885, the Catskills Forest Preserve was established by the State of New York as a primary habitat in Ulster County. Under Article XIV of the NYS constitution, the lands were provisionally said to be “forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  
     As our area developed, this environment has become increasingly fragmented and strained. No dam or hydroelectric power plant can be created in this region without disrupting, and likely causing catastrophic damage to, the natural lands. All three proposed reservoirs fall directly within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area, as well as having Status 1 land protections under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” Accordingly, the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision plan states that areas with “Status 1 or 2 protections are avoided for development proposals.” To avoid the legalities of such protections, Premium Energy Holdings is touting this as a “closed-loop” project. Simply put, this is an outright lie. All projects that add an upper reservoir to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects. 
     Finally, this is not the first time our region has been disrupted by an outside entity wishing to transform our lands into assets for the benefit of others. Construction of the Ashokan Reservoir, between 1907-1915, displaced more than 25 existing communities spread out over thousands of acres so as to create an abundant water supply for New York City. Aside from the ensuant environmental devastation and emotional trauma, the impacts of the construction are still felt today. Specifically, a decreased tax base has hindered the maintenance of public infrastructure as well as decreased the availability of public services. With the rise of Catskills tourism, prompted by events such as the Phoenicia’s Top 10 Coolest Small Towns in America ranking, our region is now home to a $1.6 billion industry that employs over 20,000 people. As of 2019, second homes generated $360 million in economic activity, and this number has skyrocketed in the past year as thousands of metropolitan homeowners relocated to the Catskills. 
     Thus, I urge FERC to strongly oppose any further considerations of this project. Premium Energy Holdings, LLC must be denied the rights to initiate any construction in the Catskills. For any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your consideration.

This project would create a concrete water storage facility at one of three places:

In Lanesville, NY  by damming Stony Clove Creek along Route 214 creating a water storage facility  of 245 acres

In Phonecia, NY by damming Woodland Valley Creek from Pantherkill Road up to Fawn Hill Lane, creating a water storage facility  of about 313 acres

In West Shokan, NY by damming Maltby Hollow Brook along Moon Haw Road, creating a water storage facility of about 226 acres

As a long-time homeowner in the region and a strong proponent of renewable energy, I am writing to express my opposition to this project. This project is massive and, if constructed, will severely damage whatever local stream is picked for the dam. As a trout fisherman, I recognize that it would significantly damage the ecology of an area that has been long been preserved by the constitution of the State of New York and local and state laws. Much of this area is pristine wilderness and its smaller streams are spawning habitat for  the native trout which are a very vital part of the natural food chain. In addition, I’m concerned (as I work frequently in New York City and use its water supply) about a negative impact on its water supply because of the connection of the project to the Ashokan Reservoir.

This is NOT a closed loop project. It’s an add-on to an existing reservoir.  This project  is not the kind of “innovation” DOE needs. If approved, it will take years to construct, and will be a net consumer of energy once in operation. It’s inherent inefficiency creates the specter of a stranded asset in the future.  The DOE ought to be investing its resources into large-scale battery storage, not this 19th Century technology.

It is vital that FERC prevent this project from moving forward.

I am vehemently opposed to this application made by Premium Energy Holdings.  The application and the project about which it relates contain many flaws, among the gravest being:

(A) The project&#39;s location in a state preserve protected by the state&#39;s constitution;
(B) The project would cause increased turbidity in the Ashokan watershed and negatively impact New York City&#39;s drinking water;
(C) The project would be detrimental to the local communities surrounding the project causing disruption to the local economy and displacing residents.

Dear Ms. Bose,
I am opposed to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
As a climate activist I support clean hydroelectric power over fossil fuels.  While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. 
In addition to damaging local ecosystems this project would be damaging to the local economy that relies on tourism for revenue and jobs.  The natural beauty and opportunity for outdoor recreation draw many to the area and is enjoyed by those of us who live nearby.
As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see.  Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.  This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. 
Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

This is not at all a closed loop project, and not at all what the DOE is explaining as the type of project or proposal they&#39;re interested in supporting. Not to mention, you&#39;re literally choosing sites for an add-on project in a U.S. Forest Preserve. The effort to fight this proposal even 5 years out is heated here locally, to put it mildly.

This proposal is shocking, outrageous and totally ill considered! And it shows NO knowledge, respect or concern for the Catskills and its people—and NYC. Clean, fresh water is the Catskills greatest resource. Which is why we have fought so hard against fracking—and won! Our tourist industry is dependent on that water, for fishing and so many other recreational activities. In addition, the Catskills has many family farms, and fresh water is crucial for livestock, cows, sheep and increasingly alpacas and horses, and of course, it is also necessary for agriculture. The Catskills are America’s first great wilderness, lost in the 19th century to other irresponsible uses, such as the destruction of the hemlock forests by the tanning industry. Due to protections, such as codifying the Catskill Park as Forever Wild in NYS law (and how does this irresponsible proposal get around THAT?), the Catskills and its waters, which were thoroughly polluted by past egregiousness, have revived. Our streams and rivers offer some of the best fly fishing, as the trout, along with many mountain critters, such as the white-tailed deer and black bear, have returned with our reforested slopes and clean water. Our waters also, and crucially,  supply drinking water to New York City, and the Ashokan Reservoir is the main reservoir whose sweet, clean waters flow to downstate. This project would put that water supply at risk!  And according to one article, the NYDEP, in addition to the Catskill towns concerned, was not even notified? And according to the same article, a Catskill town would be flooded for this? Absolutely not! That happened to too many villages to build the reservoirs. Catskillers, folks native to this area and the many downstaters now increasingly living here—and lots more have moved here due to the pandemic—simply won’t stand for this. This project would alter the hydrology of our local waters, the Esopus Creek, for starters, affect the quality of our water for recreational and drinking uses, both on a personal and commercial level, and also—and just as important—impact our wildlife, which has struggled and finally succeeded in making a comeback here. The Catskills, as anyone making such an irresponsible proposal, soon learns, are home to many committed, passionate and EFFECTIVE grass-roots environmental groups and individuals who will resist any such efforts that would result in compromising in any way our precious natural resources. My vote is a resounding NO!</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jonathan Burn under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/3/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jonathan Burn, Chichester, NY.

Dear Sirs:

FERC Ref: Premium Energy Holdings: P-15056

As a resident of Chichester NY in the Catskills, not far from the Ashokan Reservoir, I have reviewed what information is currently available on the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings  (P-15056) to build a Pumped Storage Hydropower project in the Catskills Forest Preserve.  This proposal appears to be deficient in a number of crucial ways.  

Firstly, it is proposed to build this within the boundaries of the Catskill Forest Preserve.  This represents over 700,000 acres of contiguous highly preserved land, in existence for over 135 years, and considered to be in the top 1% of New York State’s forest habitats.  Importantly, as a State Forest Preserve this is considered to be Status 1 land by the USGS and, according to the Department of Energy’s Hydropower Vision report, Status 1 lands are areas to be avoided for development.  Premium Energy’s proposals demonstrate no awareness of this and in fact appear completely contradictory to the objectives of the Department of Energy.

Secondly, Premium Energy’s proposal describes the project as a Closed Loop System, which it clearly is not.  The underlying concept of the pumped storage facility uses the Ashokan Reservoir as the lower basin, and the Ashokan is a reservoir with an inflow from the Esopus creek and other surrounding water sources, and an outflow into the New York City water system.  I understand that Department of Energy is a supporter of Closed Loop projects on the basis of their reduced environment impact.  This proposal should not be considered as such, and in fact the misrepresentation on the part of Premium Energy calls into question both their capabilities and their motivations.

Lastly, and as noted above, the Ashokan forms part of the New York City water supply, and in fact is the pivotal reservoir in that system, with over 40% of New York City’s water flowing through it.  The Catskill/Delaware Watershed and the network of reservoirs and rivers it contains, represent the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, supplying a billion gallons a day to over 9 million people.  The Ashokan provides a crucial sediment settling basin within this system, allowing sediment flowing downstream to settle in the western portion of the reservoir, where Premium Energy propose to build their Open Loop project, prior to flowing to the eastern portion of the reservoir and hence via aqueducts directly from there to New York City.  The rapid flow of water and significant water level changes inherent in a pumped storage hydropower plant would have a hugely detrimental impact on the reservoir’s primary purpose of water supply and on the turbidity of the water provided to over 9 million people.

By proposing to build this Open Loop Hydropower facility in a State Forest Preserve and the New York City Watershed, and significantly impacting a critical part of the New York City water system, Premium Energy have demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of the environment in which they propose to build.  This proposal should be rejected at this stage and not allowed to proceed.

FERC Ref: Premium Energy Holdings (P-15056)

Dear Sirs:

As a resident of Chichester NY, I have reviewed the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings (P-15056) to build a large dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels (collectively “dam”) in the Catskills Forest Preserve.  

I want to draw attention to the fact that the each of the proposed sites for the dam are located on lands that, under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, are designated to be “kept as wild forest lands.” The Article goes on to say that: “They shall not be leased, sold, exchanged or be taken by any corporation, public or private”.  Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature and then submitted to the public in a referendum. In order to avoid that, and for this plan to go forward in any manner, FERC would have to force the state of New York to condemn state land.  A case about this very matter is currently under review by the Supreme Court. [PennEast Pipeline Co. v New Jersey]. The primary issue of the case being: 

Whether the Natural Gas Act delegates to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate-holders the authority to exercise the federal government’s eminent-domain power to condemn land in which a state claims an interest

In addition to the protections afforded by the state constitution, the areas slated for possible location of the dam also comprise the catchment area for the New York City water supply (supplying approximately 1 billion gallons of water a day for use by 9M New York City residents) and are within the New York City Watershed. Such a massive construction project in this area would disrupt that water supply in many significant ways.

Additionally, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis” Program.  According to the Department of Energy’s Hydropower Vision, Status 1 lands are areas to be avoided for development.

Considering all of the above, Premium Energy Holdings’ failure in its proposal to indicate the Status 1 designation of the land selected for development, or that all of the selected possible sites for the dam are located within the catchment area for the New York City water supply, suggests both poor research and a profound ignorance of the actual nature of the land chosen for development.  As such, it seems that allowing this project – posited as it is on such a deficient understanding of the status of the land per the State constitution – a preliminary license would be ill-advised since any actual construction in the cited areas would be subject to strong and well-founded challenges and, almost certainly, to strong legal challenges not least by the State and by New York City.  Based on the foregoing facts, I strongly contend that this project should be disallowed at the earliest opportunity.

Sincerely,

I am writing in opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal to build an upper reservoir to the Ashokan Reservoir in the Catskill Forest Preserve.  
I urge FERC to REJECT the application for a feasibility study for this proposed project.  The proposed locations for this project make no sense for the following reasons:

1.	First, and most important, it would be a long, expensive legal battle because the proposal is for a project inside the boundaries of the Catskill Forest Preserve.  In 1885 a law was passed by the NY State Congress which established the Catskill Forest Preserve. From the beginning this land was protected by the State constitution as ‘Forever Wild’ land, never to be subjected to development or extraction of natural resources.   ARTICLE XIV Section 1 of the Constitution begins as follows:  “The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”.  Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.  As of 1999, more than 2000 amendments had been proposed. Only 29 made it to the referendum stage, and 20 of those passed. 

2.	This proposal is for an ADD-ON OPEN-LOOP system.  According to the Department of Energy’s own document, Pumped Storage Hydropower FAST Commissioning Technical Analysis, June 2020, “The closed-loop configuration is being favored by regulators and developers alike because it minimizes environmental impacts on watershed ecosystems and provides unconstrained flexibility to provide grid benefits.”  It also states, “Open-loop projects are often subject to lengthy environmental reviews and long-term monitoring to ensure the connection to a naturally flowing water feature produces no significant environmental impact to the local aquatic ecosystem.”

3.	The area in question qualifies as Status 1 under the USGS Gap Analysis Project.  Meaning, “An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management.  Examples of Status 1: National Parks, Wilderness Areas.” It is also my understanding that the proposed sites are a Status 1 area according to the USGS Gap Analysis, and that DoE prefers to avoid projects that are on Status 1 land.

Certainly there are numerous other reasons why I personally object to this project, as I have a home in West Shokan built by my great-grandfather.  I fully understand the need for alternative energy and to get away from fossil fuels.  This is one reason why I am a strong supporter of nuclear power.  While hydro pump projects can also be an important part of the energy storage puzzle, the sites in Premium Energy’s proposal make no sense whatsoever.

Thank you for reading and acknowledging my comments.

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:

	I write to submit my opposition to docket number P 150-56000, the proposal by Premium Energy of California, to construct a dam and two holding basins in the Catskill Mountains State Forest Preserve. if approved, This proposal, submitted by an out-of-state corporation that has no responsibility to the taxpayers and citizens of New York State, would impact land that is set aside by the NYS Constitution as forever wild, for the benefit of New Yorkers.
	As an historian and a naturalist writer, I have visited, written about, taught college students about, and enjoyed the Catskills for nearly 60 years. My family own two homes in the Catskills. To see an outside corp[oration come in and threaten to destroy our pristine mountain environment is unacceptable. The affected territory is Status 1 land; it should therefore fall under constitutional protection from such development.
	As the recent and ongoing public health crisis has demonstrated so clearly, we all need the wilderness even more than we had imagined. This proposal for a hydro facility would be counter to all of our heightened concerns for the environment. The project of Premium Energy must be rejected.

Ms. Bose,  I am writing to oppose the application of Premium Energy Holdings for construction of a pumped storage facility on the Ashokan Reservoir and lands in the Ulster County Catskill region. This land is part of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve, established in 1885, and enshrined in the New York State Constitution, to be held “forever wild,” and as such, is extremely environmentally sensitive, rated as Status 1 in the USGS Gap Analysis Program. The proposed construction should therefore, according to FERC’s guidelines, be prohibited on these lands. 
Further, the application by Premium Energy is inaccurate in that the proposed project is not a “Closed Loop” system as the application indicates. The basins of the Ashokan Reservoir feed into the Esopus Creek which continues on to the Hudson River, making it an “Open Loop” or “add-on” system. 
It is also unclear how the Reservoir, part of a public water supply system, can be used in such a project. Does this water supply not belong to the taxpayers of New York? Construction of this proposed pumped storage plant, using water pumped from the Reservoir’s basin, disturbing all the sediment at bottom, would create increased turbidity in the water supply, disturbing the downstream ecology.  And during the lengthy construction period of such a large project as this, with its tunnels, reservoir and dam, there would certainly be runoff of pollutants into the watershed. These disturbances might endanger the water quality and require the City to build an enormously expensive filtration system. And it is unclear what effect the constant pumping in and out of water might have on the existing dams on the Ashokan Reservoir, constructed in 1907-1915.  A failure of these dams would be catastrophic, and impossible for any company to mitigate or remedy.
In terms of the local history, in 1907, many families lost their lands and farms in the Esopus valley and there is still lingering feeling in the residents about what was done here. Perhaps Premium Energy, based in California, is not aware of this history and does not understand that the proposal to repeat history in flooding another valley in this area would be extremely controversial. 
I am, therefore, requesting that this proposed project application be denied by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission in the interests of the people of New York. 
Thank you for your consideration.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Donald J. Brown Jr. under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/3/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Donald J. Brown Jr., Phoenicia, NY.

Docket number P-15056-000
Dear Ms. Bose,
I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.
While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.
Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.
In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.
As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?
Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.
Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to comment on the application by Premium Energy Holdings for a preliminary permit to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains: Ashokan PSP P-15056. I urge FERC to decline this request. Sustainable energy is important to me, but this plan on the whole is not sustainable for the local environment, economy and community. The proposed project will have many negative impacts, but I will focus on three of them.

1. The proposed project area is within the protected Catskill Forest Preserve. This is Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis, which – according to the DOE’s Hydropower Vision – should be avoided for development. The 700,000-acre Preserve comprises unique continuous wildlife habitat (and falls within an Audubon Important Bird Area) and pristine forest (top 1% in the region according to the New York State Forest Condition Index). The impacts of the proposed project are greater than Premium Energy is claiming, because this is not a closed-loop system as they represent, but an add-on to an open system. (This also means the proposal is not eligible for streamlined FERC approval.) Disruption of this valuable habitat must be prevented, yet the proposed project will irreparably damage the ecology of the area by causing rapid fluctuations in water levels and continuous disturbance of sediments – not to mention the additional harm caused by the construction/development processes themselves.

2. The proposed project will negatively impact tourism and those who work in the $1.6-billion industry – roughly 20,000 or 17% of jobs - in an area already hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Premium Energy’s project will restrict access to hiking, fishing, skiing, and other forms of recreation and decrease the natural beauty, stifling tourism in the region, which has already been reduced by the coronavirus pandemic. This could cause many local businesses to close permanently.

3. The proposed project will further damage the economy and community by eliminating homes, in addition to jobs. Adding a reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve will require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain. These displaced residents will have a hard time securing new housing, given the shortage of housing – especially affordable housing – in Ulster County. 

We need sustainable energy, but not at the expense of sustainable environments, economies and communities. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for their pumped storage project — where construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness and natural resources, devastate local economies, and displace vulnerable communities.

Please understand the true impacts of Premium Energy’s proposed project and deny their preliminary permit for the Ashokan PSP P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

A a frequent traveler to the Catskills, I&#39;m writing in response to the highly problematic proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water. In addition, as one who hikes frequently in this area, I can assure you that this project would compel me to go elsewhere. When I hike, I buy meals at local bakeries, restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops. In addition, I shop at the beautiful area craft shops, bookstore, and cycling store. All these places would lose my business and those of the many hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy the natural beauty of this area.

Dear Ms. Bose,

There is deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

I&#39;m strongly urging FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

Normally I would be encouraged by a pumped storage project to help our country’s transition to renewable energy. However the forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. 

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat, and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

One negative effect is the alteration of the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. 

Further, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

It should also be pointed out that this proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. So while Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop”, their project actually is an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. 

I urge Premium Energy to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

And I urge you to deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

This proposed project is certainly going to disastrously affect the aquifers as well as drinking water. Another result will be wells drying up.

The construction will not only destroy homes, it will wipe out a good part of the local environment as well. Those residents who won&#39;t be forced to move will have to endure all the noise and disturbances involved in constructing something of this magnitude, not to mention pollution caused by the machinery and construction debris.

Olive endured the destruction of several villages by the early 20th century construction of the New York City reservoir. It&#39;s taken Olive&#39;s inhabitants a full century to adjust to having this in our midst--and it still causes inconvenience to the residents of this township.

Dangerous high voltage wires are going to be above ground in an area where we already have more than the average amount of power outages due to above-ground wiring. This construction will only serve to increase outages.

It is definitely not going to be cost effective, which means the consumer will have to make up the difference. 

It will have an adverse effect on the townships of Olive, Shandaken and Woodstock, areas already badly affected by the influx of outsiders from NYC and other downstate areas. Much of the wild land has already been wiped out by the homes built by these newcomers. 

Suggestion: Go where there is no habitation for miles and miles and stay out of the Catskills. We&#39;ve been through enough because of &#34;outsiders.&#34;</pre><hr><b>Comments of S. Chasse under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/4/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>S. Chasse, Willow, NY.
To whom it may concern,

This comment is in opposition to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

The disruption resulting from both construction and implementation of this project would be harmful to the natural, protected environment and disruptive to local communities. 

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land
under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own
Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2
under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any
corporation, public or private.”

To allow such a project to occur would not only harm wildlife, protected land, local residents, and tourism, it would set precedent for potential future projects of this kind. The serenity of the protected Forest Preserve was a primary reason we purchased our home in the Catskills in 2015, as so many others have done for decades.

My wife and I hope you will deny Premium Energy Holdings&#39; request for the preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 and halt any potential for this project to occur.

Re:  Project Docket:  P-15056

Hello, 

I am writing to comment on the Preliminary Permit application entitled the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  

I live only a few miles from the proposed Stony Clove reservoir, and I am also very familiar with the proposed Wittenberg and Woodland Valley sites.

I think the project would be terribly destructive in any of these proposed sites.  

The High Peaks area of the Catskills State Park is a well-loved recreation area for many, and a rare bit of wildness within reach for day trips from some of our most densely populated cities.  It would be a shame to diminish this with an industrial project.  Hikers and skiers in the Catskills would have views interrupted by transmission towers, anglers would have streams disturbed,  and all users and residents would have our narrow valleys disrupted for years  by construction traffic and noise.

I think this proposal should be denied.  I am afraid that if Premium Energy is granted permission to invest $5m in feasibility studies, that $5m will be like a ratchet, making it that much harder to deny a permit in the future.  This proposal clearly conflicts with existing recreational and environmental use of the area, and it should be denied now.

I am a property owner and resident of Stone Ridge, NY in Ulster County and New York City. I am strongly opposed to the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Power project for several reasons: this project (i) is an illegal project as it violates Article XIV of the New York State Constitution; (ii) will harm wildlife and preserved lands in upstate New York, which lands must be preserved for future generations; (iii) is highly likely to harm the drinking water in New York City and it is difficult to source clean drinking water for the millions of people residing ther; (iv) will harm other streams and waterways in the area with sediment, etc. (v) creates a net use of energy does not make any sense (using more than it generates);  (vi) requires building a new reservoir and dam which is damaging  as per the preceding and means that it is NOT &#34;closed loop&#34; and will therefore have a greater impact on the environment than Premium Energy is claiming; (vii) this area of the Catskills is close to New York City and has increasingly become a tourist area and an area sought after for its beauty and outdoor recreation, a large project like this will create blights on the land and will greatly dampen that enjoyment - note that Kingston New York, Marbletown, the Hunter/Windham area have had huge increases in property values in the last few years as more people seek affordable ways to seek recreation and/or live near metropolitan areas in pristine lands. If this project attempts to move forward it will be fought vigorously on the courts, as it should be.
Please DO NOT allow this project to move forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Evangeline Murphy under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/4/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Evangeline Murphy, Earlton, NY.
The Catskills have been protected by NYS constitution to keep it wild forever. This dam will not only affect the lives of those living in NYC&#39;s drinking water (and everyone in close proximity), but it will ruin land that was intended to be spared forever. This land is home to thousands, humans and wildlife alike roam these mountains for peace and a good life. This project would ruin so many ecological systems, will end up killing wildlife, and would be taking on of the most sacred spaces in NYS and making it just another for profit. I understand that the intentions are not to do harm, but that is exactly what this project would do. I beg you not to go through with it.

My name is Charles Gadol, MD.  I reside at 555 Plutarch Rd, Highland, NY, 12528.  I am writing in opposition to the preliminary permit application of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, docket # P-15056 for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project in Ulster County, NY.
I am currently a staff pathologist for Westchester Medical Center working at Health Alliance in Kingston, NY, and as medical director of the laboratory at Margaretville Hospital, an acute care access hospital close to the project area.  Also, I serve on the board and as a trail maintainer for the New York New Jersey Trail Conference.  The Trail Conference is a 501(3)(c) organization of staff and volunteers which maintains and develops over 2100 miles of trails between and including New Jersey and the Catskill Mountains.  Additionally, I am co-owner of wtf racing, LLC, which organizes and directs two popular long distance trail races in the Catskills; one is a 54 mile long race from Windham to Phoenicia, and the other is a trail marathon in the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area.  These races could become impossible if dams proposed as alternatives one and two are completed.
The dam proposed as alternative #1 creating Stony Clove Reservoir would destroy residences in Lanesville and interrupt/divide Rte 214, which is the major road connecting the northern Catskills, the town of Hunter, and Rte 23A with Phoenicia, and a major east/west highway, Rte 28.  Rte 214 traverses a deep gorge in the mountains with steep slopes on either side of the roadway.  Interruption and destruction of Rte 214 would prevent access to the NYS-DEC Devil&#39;s Tombstone campground and to trails in this area, especially including the famous and popular Devil&#39;s Path.  Residents in this area routinely use Rte 214 to get to shopping in Hunter.  Hunter and Belleayre ski centers are also accessed by Rte 214.  Bypassing Rte 214 using other roads requires driving many extra miles along roads which can be closed during winter and have been recently closed due to flood damage.
The dam proposed as alternative #2 creating Woodland Reservoir would destroy numerous residences in the Woodland area, inundating and interrupting Woodland Valley Rd., a dead end road, and blocking access to additional homes and property.  Woodland Valley Rd. leads to a very popular NYS-DEC campground at its terminus.  This campground area has at least two very popular and heavily used trailheads accessing trails in the Burroughs Range as well as the Long Path hiking trail, and trails in the Giant Ledge-Panther Mountains.
Alternative #3 creating the Wittenberg Reservoir would close Moonhaw Rd, another dead end road, destroying and isolating multiple residences.  Although no official trails begin in this area, the end of Moonhaw Rd. is used for backcountry access to several high peaks which see a lot of foot traffic (Friday, Balsam Cap, Lone and Rocky Mountains).
The areas impacted by the proposed alternative dam sites, and indeed the entire Catskill area, are heavily dependent on tourism.  Tourism has increased dramatically in recent years and especially during the pandemic.  Closure of major roads and disruption of trailhead access caused by the proposed dams and reservoirs would significantly impact tourism prospects and could be a death blow to a traditionally economically depressed area.  The disruption and unsightliness caused by construction of tunnels and transmission lines would also be damaging to tourism.  Loss of homes and livelihoods for area residents would also be disastrous.
The need for increased power and generating capacity in the Hudson Valley has not been demonstrated.  This area includes lands preserved as wilderness and wild forest, a widely dispersed population with small towns and cities, some light industry, and a strong agricultural component to the local economy.  Any new energy challenges should be met by renewable energy sources according to the recently passed NY State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
As described earlier, closure of either Rte 214 or Woodland Valley Rd. would be detrimental to the trail races that I operate, which are permitted by NYS-DEC, preventing travel to and access to different parts of the race courses.  This could especially present issues regarding safety and communications, as well as providing aid to participants.  These races bring several hundred people into the area annually, producing additional benefit to the local economy.
In conclusion, I urge you to deny the preliminary permit application of Premium Energy Holdings, for all the reasons I have presented.

In Reference to: FERC Project and Subdocket Number: P-15056:000

My wife and I moved to the Woodland Valley as full-time residents in March 2020. The pandemic brought added challenges to living in New York City and we found ourselves with limited options to turn.


We bought our cabin in the protected Catskill Forest Preserve a year earlier to enjoy one of the most natural, ecologically significant areas in all of New York State. Its historical significance to trout fishing, fresh natural water and camping all create an ecosystem that is both a wonderful place to live, but it also attracts a growing number of tourists from throughout New York and surrounding states to the Woodland Valley area.


Since moving permanently to the area, it’s become even more clear how important the tourism is to maintaining local businesses and creating jobs. People travel from hours away to explore the trail heads accessible from the Woodland Valley campground, which was developed in the 1930s and is one of New York’s oldest camp sites. More than 5,000 people each year come to this area for the natural beauty and hiking trail experience, which then leads them to the surrounding businesses, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, gift and apparel stores, and more.


As a $1.6 billion dollar industry in the Catskill region, it creates close to 9,000 jobs in the Ulster County area alone. Unemployment rates are also on the decline with more people fleeing New York City for space and more time outdoors. In April 2020, at the very beginning of the pandemic and a pivotal point in the year for tourism uptick, the unemployment rate rose to 14.6% - up from 4.2% just two months prior. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.8% in February 2021. With the introduction of this power plant and the decrease in accessible trails, fishing and other outdoor activities, unemployment rates can only spike again.


While we understand that new developments of all types may support the public good—the proposed pumped-storage hydro plant in Woodland Valley brings vastly more negative consequences than benefits.


More specifically, my wife and I appreciate the global energy transition taking place and renewable power is an important component of lessening our dependence on fossil fuels. But this hydro plant is not in line with the preference of the Department of Energy and it would require more energy to operate than it would ultimately create from pumping water to the upper reservoir and back down again. This effectively feels like a greenwashing exercise or ‘energy arbitrage’ approach whereby Premium Energy would be spending cheap power to make expensive power.


Premium Energy, despite knowing the inefficiencies of its project, would be uprooting protected forests and fresh-water habitats to build a large dam, reservoir, turbines and tunnels. These developments would upend the Woodland Valley and local communities.

 
Equally important to the challenged economics of this project is the fact that it would wreak irreparable damage on the ecology of this protected forest area that thousands of business owners and visitors rely on. The Woodland Valley’s businesses and tourism, and its natural environment of fish, animals and plants—are all interdependent. The more people that come to this area to experience its streams and trails helps reinforce the significance of forest preservation and, in turn, helps maintain a constant flow of tourism to this area’s businesses.

 
Please honor the protected Catskills forest and stop this proposal from moving forward.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I grew up in the Catskill Mountains and many of my earliest memories revolve around the Ashokan Reservoir. Although I live about an hour away now, I still go back to the area whenever I can to visit the forever wild lands that are so important to me. Therefore, I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I learned recently from my friends in Olive that there is a plan to build a hydroelectric power plant nearby. This news stunned me. The Catskills has become a land very dear to my community and myself and has been a refuge over the last couple of years.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process.

It is critical that we stop and consider the unintended consequences that will come about with this “transition.”

Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I am a NY resident and avid admirer of the Catskills and would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and I ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  


All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”


The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 


In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats.  Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.


I and the community understand the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time, 

Sincerely,
Tara</pre><hr><b>Comments of Gilbert Hsiao under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/4/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Gilbert Hsiao, Olivebridge, NY.

I am writing to share some facts pertaining to why Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric dam in any of the three locations(Olive, Woodland, and Lanesville, NY) proposed in the Catskill Forest Preserve should not go forward.

First, all the locations proposed are located on protected land that is designated Status 1 by the United States Geological Society under the USGS Gap Analysis program, which provides “permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and mandated management plan to maintain a natural state.” (see https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/pad-us-data-overview?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

Second, even if the proposed land did not have Status 1, Premium seems to be trying to take shortcuts by misrepresenting the nature of the project. It is calling their project a closed loop system, with limited environmental impact, and high in desirability by entities such as DOE, while in actuality it is an add on system, adding on to the Esopus Creek or the Ashokan Reservoir. The artificial raising and lowering of water levels of the creek would have an adverse impact on the ecologically rich and fragile Esopus. The Ashokan Reservoir itself is fed by the Esopus. Both provide almost half of the drinking water to the 8.5 million residents of New York City.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Robert Cornett under P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings (PEH) to build a hydroelectric power plant in the Catskill Forest Preserve area of New York state. This project would be absolutely devastating to the environment, disruptive to local communities and have high risk to the purity of NY City’s drinking water.  I along with many other individuals, organizations and town councils in this area urge you to decline PEH’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. There has been a thorough review of the PEH proposal by environmental and energy consultants who have confirmed that this is not a suitable location for a pumped storage facility.

The proposal is in violation of Article XIV of the NY State Constitution which has guaranteed that the Catskill Forest Preserve “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands and shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. The project would cause significant destruction to the forest and lands around the proposed sites and environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. A Pumped storage facility will wreak havoc on nearby stream ecology and land habitats. It will affect wildlife and alter sediment regimes in connected tributaries including the Esopus Creek, near my property which  feeds into the Ashokan Reservoir which supplies over 40% of NY City’s water supply and is a vital trout breeding stream. Water fluctuations caused by this project would increase turbidity within the Ashokan Reservoir and its watershed threatening the water supply to NY City and causing issues in nearby communities.

Any of the proposed upper reservoir sites in the PEH proposal would also be damaging to local communities and property owners due to the seizing of homes and property via eminent domain. This will be a repeat of the devastating displacement of people and communities 100 years ago when the Ashokan was constructed.

Due to these serious environmental and community impacts It would be totally reckless of FERC to approve this preliminary permit request.  PEH should be directed to look for more suitable and less destructive locations for this kind of project.

There is a wealth of evidence from around the world showing the waterfall of devastation that follows from ill-conceived hydro-electric works. To sell off our dwindling natural resources to unaccountable for-profit enterprise in the face of this wealth of evidence would suggest collusion between corporate greed and elected officials whose duty it is to protect our planet and our future.

I am a resident of West Shokan in the Town of Olive in Ulster County, NY.
A preliminary permit application (The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project) is now before FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This proposal includes building a large dammed reservoir in a New York State forest, an underground hydropower plant in West Shokan, and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the Town of Ulster. If allowed to proceed, this project will have materially  detrimental impact on our community.

I am opposed to The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for three reasons:

1. The Premium Energy proposal is not the kind of green energy project that the Department of Energy (DoE) wants:
• Premium Energy is proposing an open-looped pumped-storage hydropower project where the lower reservoir will be continuously connected to a naturally flowing upper reservoir. Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval.
• Turbidity will prove a significant issue, as a &#39;lack&#39; of this problem is the one reason the Ashokan reservoir does not require a filtration plant (as do NYC&#39;s other reservoirs).  This project threatens to force NYC to undergo the substantial investment of a new filtration plant, given the turbidity this project threatens to introduce.
• Premium Energy is claiming this to be “closed-loop.” It is not. Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects. That is what this project is.  Premium Energy is not being honest in its declarations.
• “Initial construction impacts” for open-loop projects are lower, but “operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the add-on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.” (Source: DoE: “A Comparison of the Env. Effects of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower.” April 2020)

2. There’s a substantial negative impact on highly preserved land:
• Premium Energy appears to be completely unaware that they are proposing a project in an extremely protected state preserve, a Status 1 area according to the USGS Gap Analysis.  Change in the State Forest Preserve is rare:
o Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.
o As of 1999, more than 2,000 amendments have been proposed. Only 29 made it to the referendum stage; of those, 20 passed. (Source: The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line)
• The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the DoE’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
• Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”
• The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.
• All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https://www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area.
• This area is protected for a reason.  It should not be disturbed.

3. There is a significant negative Impact on stream ecology
o Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats.
o Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the New York City water supply.
o A valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

As a resident in this impacted area, I urge you to intervene to stop this Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  Its harm is incalculable.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing to urge you to decline this proposal. While renewal energy storage is important, this is NOT the appropriate location.  

This land is part of the Catskill Forest Preserve and is deemed forever wild in the NYS constitution.  There is so little forever protected land left; it is imperative to keep it protected.  This alone, should be reason enough to not allow this project to be approved here.

This project will greatly affect the ecology of the streams that feed these proposed reservoirs.  The increased turbidity and highly fluctuating water levels from pumped storage will cause the trout population to decline and likely disappear.  Trout rely on cold/deep, clear water to survive.  Their habitat will be ruined and this will affect the entire food web.  Trout fishing is also a major source of income for the towns along the Esopus Creek.  This would devastate a major part of their economy.      

This project proposes to use the Ashokan Reservoir as its lower basin.  This is drinking water for NYC residents.  Pumped storage will increase the turbidity in the reservoir, making it impossible to remain the largest unfiltered reservoir in the country.  This is irresponsible and reckless to allow this to happen to such a vital resource for the largest urban population in the US.  

Renewable energy solutions should work in harmony with the environment.  They should not decrease the quality of an ecosystem. This project is claiming to be a &#39;closed loop&#39; project, when actually, it is an add-on project. This add-on project is proposing to use an existing drinking water reservoir for the nation&#39;s largest city as its lower basin.  This is a high risk project that will be detrimental to this vital resource and to the ecology of the area.  Premium Energy Holding, LLC is lying about this being a &#39;closed loop&#39; project to get a quick approval.  They are NOT to be trusted.   

I hope you carefully take these points into consideration and do NOT allow this proposal to move forward.  Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

While I am a fervent supporter of projects that contribute to our transition to renewable energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, there are multiple reasons why Premium Energy Holdings Ashokan Pumped Storage Project is the wrong project in the wrong place.

While closed-loop projects are considered to have less environmental impact and are eligible for streamlined FERC approval, this project is not, as Premium has erroneously represented it, a closed-loop project but, in fact, an add-on project which is subject to a higher level of scrutiny.

In addition, all of Premium’s proposed reservoir sites are in the Catskills Forest Preserve. Under the New York State constitution these lands “shall be forever kept as wild...not leased, sold, exchanged, or be taken by any corporation...” Under the Dept. of Energy’s own guidelines, Status 1 land, as the Preserve has been designated by them, should be “avoided for development.” Our wild lands are our children’s irreplaceable heritage and the protection of the purity of our waterways. Damage done by development cannot be undone.

It is known that the rapid fluctuations of water resulting from this project will wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats, alter the sediment regime in the Esopus aggravating an already problematic turbidity problem, affect New York City’s water supply, and destroy priceless trout breeding habitat.

Alternate energy technologies are rapidly being developed and improved but Premium Energy’s planned project is ill conceived and attains nowhere near the efficiency desirable in a sustainable energy source because of its need to use energy to make energy. It is destined to become, in time, another costly white elephant blighting the landscape like the decommissioned nuclear power plants that, not so long ago, also seemed like a good idea.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I urge the FERC to reject the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 should be shut down immediately as it will be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

As a frequent visitor to the beautiful Catskill Mountain area, and drinker of the water provided to Brooklyn via the Ashokan Reservoir I am vehemently opposed to this project. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that the Catskill Forest Preserve lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 

We look to you and all our elected officials to uphold the constitution and protect public land, especially against private interest groups and corporations. The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Furthermore, should the project be approved - pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. 

It would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. 

Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. 

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

My name is Kevin Boyer and I have been educating myself about the specifics of the “Ashokan Pumped Storage Project,” proposed by Premium Energy – FERC project number P-15056-000 – which I strongly oppose.  

As a resident of the immediate area that would be affected, I’ve quickly learned several key things. A proposal and project such as this has huge legal ramifications at many levels, knowing that New York State’s objection to such development will cause this to be tied up in legal wrangling for many years. This highly preserved land has been so since 1885, when the NYS Constitution declared this 700K acres of continuous wildlife habitat of Catskills forest be “forever kept as wild.” As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program – and the DEP has said land areas designated as Status 1 or 2 will be “avoided for development.” This alone should be enough to halt this proposal immediately.  However, if this proposal did in fact get any traction, it would have to be passed by a constitutional amendment by the NYS Constitution, voted on by two consecutive sessions in state legislature and then submitted to the public for referendum. I’ve learned that this is really difficult to do – and Premium Energy seems to be completely unware they are proposing a project in such a protected environment.  (As you likely know, since 1999 there have been 2000 proposals and only 20 have passed.) 

These highly preserved state lands are kept so for many important ecological reasons, perhaps most notably the important bird and fish wildlife habitats that would be lost if such a project were to move forward. The surrounding Catskill’s area and Ashokan Reservoir make up the largest unfiltered drinking supply in the nation – is that not important?  A hydroelectric plant will impact the water’s turbidity and increase stream sediment that runs into the reservoir – affecting the water’s purity and in essence altering a clean source that currently provides 40% of New York City’s drinking water (feeding 9.5 million people). 

Equally as important to note, this proposal by Premium Energy is not factual. This proposal is NOT for a closed-loop project, it is an add-on project since an upper reservoir would be added on to a lower reservoir – so this proposal is, in fact, deficient and untrue. Premium Energy does not deserve the special consideration FERC may give to closed-loop projects. 

The scope of such a project will literally be life altering for both humans and animals that would be displaced, not to mention the impact it would have on the local tourism economy, which continues to grow, reliant on the natural beauty of this region. In 2019 Ulster County represented over 40% of that market. 

There are countless reasons this is a bad idea and I will continue to research and fight to stop this proposal from going further.  This proposed project cannot happen. 

Thank you.

I am a resident and homeowner in Chichester NY, Ulster County. I am unequivocally opposed to the proposed hydropower project currently under review by FERC (docket number P-15056).

We moved this area in 2007 primarily because of its astounding beauty and the fact that at our doorstep are all the amazing flora and fauna of the Catskills forest. 

While I am in support of renewable and sustainable energy sources and recognize that sometimes there is a “greater good” with some energy projects-- this is not one of them. 

 The proposed project would have a detrimental effect on the ecology of the Catskills Forest Preserve (established in 1885) and on the wellbeing of the flora and fauna in this habitat, including the Ashokan Reservoir and larger New York City Watershed system.
Premium Energy Holding’s claim that it will build an “enclosed loop” system is false; closer study indicates their proposal is actually an “open loop” system. The environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 
The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve. This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Constitutional amendment is required for any change in the management of State Forest Preserves. This process involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum; it is otherwise unlawful and unconstitutional. 
As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. The US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report states that, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy Holding’s proposal; and the Department of Energy’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Docket number P-15056-000

My name is Chauncey Upson, and I own 158 acres of land in silver hollow, chichester ny.  i am one of the largest private contiguous land owners in ulster county and vote and pay taxes here.  I have been here for over 20 years.   my land is right next to one of the 3 sites from this flawed proposed project (stony clove).  

As a land owner, with warner creek in my property, i have had extensive interactions with the DEP over stream maintenance over the past 2 decades. my thoughts below are intimately informed by interactions with the DEP and ultimately management of the catskills watershed creek on my own land.      

these creeks up here are high velocity creeks, at steep gradients.   that means they transport immense amounts of sediment.   stony clove creek for example is the steepest gradient creek in ALL of the catskills mountains.   this project is counter to basic logic.  

this means that ANY impoundment (i.e. dam) of this creek will bring with it rock, sand,  silt and other sediment build up.   this will require constant (and costly) regular dredging and removal of debris.   something which your plan does  not foresee in its viability study.   if this dredging process is not regularly undertaken, then the dam will eventually breach, thereby subjecting the entire downstream portions of stony clove to damaging floods.

this is basic science.   the maintenance of the dam you propose alone would make it uneconomic.  

i am leaving aside the other catastrophic negative impacts to the local economy (loss of road access, loss of wild life, hiking, impact on water quality for the NYC water shed, etc).  i am purely talking about the severe flaws in the basis premise for this project.  

food for thought:   since the DEP has been taking data from stony clove:   the floods are way under estimated.   this valley can not take more water.   IRENE was supposed to be a one in 100 year story.   it was the record in the past 23 years of data taken by DEP.   but the Grinch storm of 2020 was &#34;only&#34; a 1 in 10 year storm, and look at the damage done.   these creek beds can not take MORE water.  

the proposal from Premier will lead to water levels rising by some 5 feet when fully in use.   this is WAY above levels of peak flooding that we have seen in past, which has destroyed homes, roads, wildlife and ecology, and infrastructure alike.   all to the detriment of the NYC watershed drinking water.  

this project will not work.   ANY dam project in the catskills will not work.   this is the forever wild protected watershed of the 20m people in the NYC metropolitan region.  

i expect in short order the full power and voice of both the DEC and the DEP to further convince you of the special considerations needed in this region vis a vis the NYC watershed.  

please listen to this basic scientific logic and deny any feasibility study to build a pumped storage facility in this region.  
 
thanks,

 As a resident of the town of Olive one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.

I am writing to urge FERC to reject the proposal (Docket # 15056-0000) submitted by Premium Energy for a pumped-storage hydroplant to be constructed in the Catskill Forest Preserve.

 While the goal of increasing the use of renewable energy is an important one, constructing a pumped storage plant and dam within this highly preserved and legally protected forestland and watershed is manifestly contrary to the public good. 

    The Department of Energy has publicly stated that “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

    Premium Energy’s proposal is flawed in that it purports to describe a closed-loop system, whereas it is clearly an add-on utilizing, as its lower reservoir, the Ashokan reservoir, itself an engineering marvel of enormous historical and economic significance. 

    Because of the importance of the Ashokan Reservoir and the surrounding forest preserve, it is legally protected by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution: “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands, [and] shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  The Ashokan reservoir was built, almost exactly a century ago, by means of eminent domain and the displacement of an entire community of towns and farms. This constitutional promise of protection must be kept. 

    There is widespread community opposition to this plan, among not only residents but also visitors to the Preserve, many of them from New York City and other urban areas who value the chance to enjoy unspoiled wilderness within a few hours’ drive. Community groups and organizations across the political spectrum are united in their determination to protect this preserve, as their State Constitution has promised them it would. 

I urge the commission to consider these and other reasons raised by public commentary and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

Thank you,

I am writing concerning the proposal for the Ashokan Reservoir pumped storage project. I am a member of Croton Watershed Chapter of the national conservation organization Trout Unlimited.  There are 625 members of the Croton Watershed chapter who live in the Hudson Valley area in NY State.  Although we do not live in Ulster County, NY, many of us travel to Ulster to fly fish for trout in the Esopus Creek and other Catskill streams.  When we travel to fish the Esopus, we purchase food and lodging in the nearby towns in Ulster.  Right now tourism generates more than $600 million dollars and 15% of jobs in Ulster County and fishing/outdoor recreation contributes a large share to the tourism dollars and jobs.  The pumped storage project by pumping and releasing the turbid water from and into the Ashokan and mixing the normally stratified layers of cooler and warmer water has the potential to make the Esopus Creek, a turbid warmer water stream that would destroy the trout fishery.  This would be a serious detriment to those of us who travel from out of the area to fish in the Esopus and would have large impact on the recreational tourist spend and jobs maintained  in the area. Furthermore, pumped storage is not an efficient way of green energy generation because it is a net consumer of energy. Our Trout Unlimited Chapter joins with the others who have expressed the opinion that this project should not be approved because of its detrimental impact on outdoor sports recreation/tourism that generates dollars and jobs for the region from individuals in and traveling to the region from elsewhere in NY.  When local economies are already staggering from the effects of COVID, a project like this that will destroy a major local recreational tourist business should not be allowed to go forward.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I have friends and family who are members of the Catskills community that would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 



A site where the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  



All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 



Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 



The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”



The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 



In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.



Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 



I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 



Thank you.

It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Ms. Bose,

My name is Sara Villard and I am a resident and small business owner in this area.  I’m appalled at the idea residents here should have to worry about eminent domain for this project. The tourism here is also essential to most people in the area. The upheaval and devastation of the general population in 2020 and beyond the pandemic has been enough for the people of the Catskills to endure.  Now we should worry about the devastation of our natural resources, land, and our homes and businesses?  

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056 because of the huge risk it poses to the environment and NYC’s drinking water.


Pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process.

Dear Secretary Bose,

This correspondence is in direct response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA. Sandra E. Friedel is filing a motion to be an intervener and meets the requirements of 18 CFR 385.214 of the Commission’s regulations to be granted full party status.

The basis for intervening is due to the proposed location of the project (Wittenberg Reservoir) would mean that I would lose my home and access to my property. Therefore, I have substantial interest in the matter. I reside on 65 Friedel Drive that is directly off Moonhaw Road, West Shokan, NY 12494.

Sandra E. Friedel respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion
to intervene.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Re: Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

I am officially registering my comments and concerns with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC with regard to the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. I have been a resident of Olive for the past 24 years. I was blind sighted by the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. I have huge concerns with this project proceeding in this beautiful and eco sensitive location. This project would be unquestionably detrimental to this area. The following is a partial list of how this area, its residents, wildlife and environment would be compromised:
 
Environment: This beautiful area has seen a surge in the once endangered Bald Eagle, as well as recent sightings of the Red Crossed Bill. In addition to these beautiful birds there are a huge number of land and aquatic animals that would be gravely impacted by this project. Destroying forests for this project would impact wildlife. Creating dams would impact fish, all forms of aquatic life as well as destroying forests, pastures, fields and streams, and all forms of plant and animal life that exist in those natural environments. How will fish migrate between all the reservoirs unharmed? The level of the environmental impact is astronomical. And the damage done could never be reversed.

Well water: People in this area have well water. This type of massive construction both above and below ground can have a catastrophic negative impact on local well water. Just the recent construction on Rt. 28 has turned the Ashokan Reservoir brown for months. Often, sediments and toxins are not visible and could cause harm to those drinking the water as well as the surrounding wildlife. When our neighbor dug their own well on new construction, our well water turned brown for months.
Will this construction impact the water table? Could wells run dry? And what contaminants will be introduced into the water supply? It is not worth the risk to thousands of residences.

Homeowners: Those families that would be displaced by this project would face incredible and possibly insurmountable difficulties. Even if the families are reimbursed for their homes. The unique recent surge of people from New York City relocating to our area, due to COVID, is larger than any we have ever experienced. Homes have hugely increased in their selling price. People purchasing homes are paying with cash, driving the real estate market up. Availability of homes to purchase is very low if nonexistent in the most desired areas. The people having to relocate would not be able to find compatible homes in this market, leaving them at a huge loss both financially and emotionally.

Would solar or wind be more economically viable?

How much co2 and methane is projected to be produced?

Will a warning system be in place in case of a dam collapse?

This beautiful area is a natural treasure and moving ahead with the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will destroy its beauty, permanently scar the environment as well as have devastating impacts on the people, animals, and plant life that exist here on these precious lands. I stand firmly against this project!</pre><hr><b>Comments of Dana Chaifetz under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/5/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Dana Chaifetz, chichester, NY.

Dear Ms Bose,

I implore FERC to reject the request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.. This project is wrong and immoral for so many reasons. 
This is a danger to the NY water supply .It will displace residents and tourists. 
This land is protected by the constitution and is legally preserved to be forever wild.
The land is used and enjoyed by many and contributes to the quality of life for residents and tourists. It would be terribly destructive and damaging to the environment and equally as disruptive and damaging to our local communities. 

In short, this project has no place here. It must be built elsewhere. 
Please, do what’s right and do not allow this terrible project to ruin what we have preserved here-  truly sacred land.

Sincerely ,
Dana Chaifetz</pre><hr><b>Comments of Calandra Cruickshank under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/5/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Calandra Cruickshank, Big Indian, NY.

Regarding: Docket Number P-15056-000

To Whom It May Concern:

I write to formally submit that I am against Premium Energy Holdings, LLC’s proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. 

The 700,000 acre Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” This project would clearly go against this intent and simultaneously endanger forest around the proposed sites that ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 

All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Sanctuary. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Additionally, according to The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line, changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. 

As someone who lives on a former trout hatchery in the Catskills, established by my great-great-grandfather, I also am concerned about the impacts on stream ecology. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and a critical part of the NYC water supply. Valuable trout breeding habitat would be lost and there could be significant impacts to the NYC water supply. According to the DEP, this area provides 40% of NYC’s water, a water supply that provides 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people. 

In summary, this project does not represent the innovation that the Department of Energy would want. I urge you to stand against this project and shut it down.

As a resident of NYC, and as someone who studies the history of NYC&#39;s drinking water watershed, I strongly oppose the development of the pumped storage project at Ashokan Reservoir. This project will undeniably compromise the health and quality of the water supply of NYC and the other upstate towns that rely on the water from the Catskill water system. The current restrictions on development within the Catskills are there for a reason, to protect the water. Energy and electricity can be found and produced in other ways and means, but water —and especially water of the quality that is in the watershed— cannot be so easily found. Since the late 1800s water stewards have fought to find and maintain clean drinking water for NYC, why should this project compromise decades of work.

As a lifelong resident of the Catskills who grew up directly on the Ashokan Reservoir, I&#39;m devastated by the potential of the environmental and social havoc this project will have on the Catskills. For a company not based in the area, they can&#39;t don&#39;t have any notion of the importance of the Catskills and the Forever Wild environment. We CANNOT allow special interest groups to invade our towns and land with the clear intention to destroy the precious land which has been protected for so long and needs to be preserved for future generations.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
I am a resident of the Hudson Valley and Catskills area and would like to register my opposition to a project under your consideration, Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. I ask that this permit be denied based the concerns that follow, along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and other concerned citizens. 
First, Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices and reliability. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy for a project that would deeply disrupt the Forever Wild areas as well as protected species.

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage but cannot depend upon the deceptive information provided by Premium Energy for this project. In addition, the proposed locations for this project are in the habitat of threatened species, Forever Wild areas and Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your consideration of these concerns as you review the permits for this project.

Gretchen Hildebran</pre><hr><b>Comments of Anne Miller under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/5/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Anne Miller, Mount Tremper, NY.
Dear Ms. Bose, 

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water. 

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country. 

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone. 

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond. 

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval? 

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources. 

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Docket number P-15056-000
My family and I are directly impacted by the proposal, and are strongly opposed to it (both as primary residents in Phoenicia, and as property owners in NYC).  We have carefully reviewed the proposal and have the following concerns with the proposal: 
1)	Environmental
a.	Negative impact on wildlife (fish, birds, deer, bobcats, bears, etc) 
b.	Disruption of underground oil, propane, gas tanks (locations may not be known or these may be inadequately permitted).  The proposal would directly lead to risk of these flooding the supply
c.	Previous industrial sites that are in the flood zone and not documented 
d.	Water quality in NYC – increased risk to requiring filtration which would make the proposal economically non-viable
2)	Merits of the proposal 
a.	Not sufficient detail to understand approach or merits of proposal; risks are not defined, and not captured in the proposal 
b.	Mathematical errors in their proposal are either intentional or careless – the proposal should be submitted and be internally consistent and accurate 
c.	Risk of drought increased (surface areas of reservoir and moving water daily would significantly reduce the water available in the reservoir) – it is not a closed system.  This significantly increases risk of a water outage and has direct impacts on other reservoirs 
d.	Team is not qualified to execute on this type of project – inadequate track record of execution for projects of this magnitude
e.	Inadequate reserve funds available – similar proposals have required 10-20x of the project cost held in cash in a reserve fund to ensure requirements met and no damages
f.	Better proposals elsewhere (e.g., lithium battery) that are more cost effective, efficient; old technology is used for the proposal – this is not efficient and not effective 
g.	Proposal should include DEC / DEP / Ulster County Healthy and Safety representatives to oversee all activity (in person monitoring)  
h.	Property value has significantly increased in last 5 years (~2x value) and this is not accounted for in financial calculations of value 
3)	Legality of the approach 
a.	Violation of 10th Amendment in US constitution and NY state constitution 
b.	California company without alien company registration in NYS or Ulster County 
c.	Federal laws violation including Endangered Species Act and FEMA regulations
d.	State Laws violation including Fish &amp; Wildlife and DEC / DEP regulations  
e.	Ulster County lacks legal authority to grant local permit and exposes both members of the community and individuals who sign permits to civil and criminal penalties 
f.	This is not in the public interest due to the inefficiency in the approach and other more favorable options – local and federal tax incentives cannot be used to justify a seizure of property that is not in the community interest 
4)	Impact on the community
a.	Impact of data requests / research on the Town Hall staff and inability to meet other requests for permitting (lack of town resources) 
b.	Impact to fishing / hunting / camping which is currently used in the area 
c.	History of disrupted / displaced individuals – there are not adequate housing supplies available in the area to support displaced families (and also not available construction workers to build new houses) 
d.	Graves in the local area that would be disturbed  
e.	The impacted community extends well beyond the flood zone and will impact erosion along the waterway as well ad impact community / property value and potential uses 
f.	Additional risk to COVID exposure by the community, which is in violation of current CDC guidelines as these are non-essential business activities</pre><hr><b>Comments of Danielle Campisi under P-15056.

I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Hello,
I&#39;m reaching out to express my disapproval of the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Our preserved land would be negatively impacted, along with private property owners who are already facing extreme uncertainty during the COVID pandemic and potentially negative consequences to NYC&#39;s main water source. Not to mention, tourism in the area could suffer as people like me are dismayed by the development disrupting one of my most favorite areas near the Ashokan Reservoir.

Please do not let this proposal, or others like it, go forward.

# 1  As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.

I live within 1 mile of the Ashokan Reservoir. I oppose this ill-conceived, reckless proposal. While its intention may be noble, its implementation on the ground, or under it, would be disastrous for the environment, for New York City&#39;s water supply, and for the locals like myself who live nearby. The Ashokan Reservoir is a beautiful, protected part of our town and a major source of clean water for New York City. This proposal would violate our state&#39;s constitution which protects our reservoir. It would have a terrible impact on the lives of those of us who live nearby. And it would endanger the purity of the water that New York City relies on. I believe in alternative source of energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. However, this is not a good alternative. Please respect our protected lands and water and reject this proposal. Thank you, Zachary Sklar</pre><hr><b>Comments of Leslie Fleischman under P-15056.

I am writing to oppose the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Facility submitted by Premium Energy Holdings. Docket #P-15056:000.

Pumped storage is a flawed solution that uses more power than it stores,  is expensive, and damages the area’s ecology with the rapid changes in water level in the upper reservoir. 

The project is proposed within the Catskills Forest Preserve, with impacts on formally protected and ecologically valuable land. The U.S. Department of Energy itself has recognized that development on such lands should be avoided. 

The movement of water in pumped storage can affect the sediment regime and stream ecology. This is of heightened concern, since excessive sediment is already a major issue affecting the Ashokan Reservoir and the quality of NYC’s unfiltered drinking water. The project would likely affect the 9.5 million residents of New York City and many Hudson Valley communities that rely on its drinking water. It also has significant implications on the health of the Esopus Creek and the communities on its banks, and to the communities that draw drinking water from the Hudson River.

Given the areas appeal to tourism due to its pristine wilderness areas it seems counter to rational thought to allow such destruction to our area that would not appear to create excess power to alleviate the need for energy, instead wasting our valuable natural resources for little assistance in energy needs. There are better ways to create clean energy without trading our Catskill Forest Preserve for another manmade plant that will affect everything for miles around it. This is not the time to take apart more of nature but more the time to learn to live in harmony with nature and live within the perfect balance rather than destroy it. 

The Ashokan Reservoir, NYC watershed, and the Catskill Forest Preserve are not the right place for a pumped storage project.

I sincerely hope that these comments will be taken into consideration as we are the people who live here and enjoy the natural resources provided by the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Thank you for your consideration,

Ms. Bose,

Please help keep the Catskills as wild as they currently are. You have a great power yielded unto you by your position and title, and I implore and beg you to please keep the Catskill Forest forever wild. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the NY State Constitution bans the sale of land and removal and sale of trees but from a fundamental level of common sense, the proposal would strip the land and its people of the one commonality they all share, a deep and abiding passion for the Catskill Forest.

It would be irresponsible and downright negligent if the proposed dam by Premium Energy Holdings is allowed to pass. It would destroy the very character of the “Preserve.” This beautiful land would no  longer be preserved - it would be exploited.

One pocket of land here, another patch of land there, another few hundred acres here. This is a slippery slope that will hurt the land, it’s communities, nature itself, and benefit a company 3,000 miles away.

I urge you to please keep these lands forever wild, and forever beautiful.

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills’ most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy’s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim—it is in fact an “add-on,” and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy’s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain—a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project’s effect on the Catskills’ growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy’s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area’s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy’s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be “closed-loop” rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,

I am writing in solidarity with the Catskills community opposing the proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. 

While there is a need for clean energy and pumped storage, I share the concern that these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species, Forever Wild areas and Status 1 protected land.

A site where the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy.

As a frequent visitor to this community, and in solidarity with those living there, I ask that you deny this permit based on these points.

Thank you for your time,

Sincerely,
Eva Armour</pre><hr><b>Comments of Catherine E James under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/5/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Catherine E James, Woodstock, NY.
As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. docket number P-15056-000

This is an ill-thought out, environmentally devastating and totally inappropriate project that will impact local people and wildlife.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Susan J McClellan under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/5/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Susan J McClellan, Barnet, VT.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

As a frequent visitor to the Catskill Mountains, I&#39;m writing to object to the flawed and dishonest proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant there. I strongly urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. 

Premium Energy is lying: Their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Premium claims that this project is “closed-loop.” But it is actually an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This is extremely risky, especially when the lower reservoir is a vital source of drinking water for New York. We cannot trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval.

The long-protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be endangered. Article XIV of the NYS Constitution clearly guaranteed that these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” It would be criminal to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, a habitat for countless important and endangered species. And this flawed project would set a horrible precedent, dooming protected lands across the country.

On a personal note, I am deeply saddened because I am planning to buy a home in the Catskills to retire to in the next year or so. But I would not want to see what the region looks like if such a devastating project is allowed to go through. The damage would be enormous to the natural environment (supposedly protected for eternity!) as well as to tourism, jobs, and many unique communities. Not to mention that 100 years ago, the region already endured something much like this. Valleys were flooded, homes and entire towns destroyed and relocated, and livelihoods ruined. It is NOT OK to do this again, especially when the company is lying – seriously  misrepresenting their plan simply to gain a preliminary permit. Then they have their foot in the door and endanger what is &#34;forever protected.&#34;

Premium Energy should look for a more suitable location for a pumped storage project—one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources. Transition to renewable green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Rules, Practices and Procedures (18 CFR Section 385.314), the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference (Trail Conference), a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of New York with its primary office in Mahwah, New Jersey, hereby petitions the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant it full party status in the above captioned proceeding. 

The person to whom communications should be addressed and to whom service should be made is as follows:

Joshua Howard, Executive Director

600 Ramapo Valley Road
Mahwah, NJ 07430

As grounds for this Motion, the Trail Conference, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has a vital and unique interest in the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the Commission by Premium Energy Holdings for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056). 

The Trail Conference is recognized as an advocate for the Catskill region, working with more than 80 member organizations and a combined membership of almost 100,000 concerned trail users, citizens, and strategic partners to ensure the integrity and quality of trail-based recreation. That includes the protection of the natural areas surrounding the trails in the Forever Wild lands of the Catskill Forest Preserve in Ulster County, N.Y.

The Trail Conference has a signed Volunteer Stewardship Agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that authorizes a stewardship program between the Commissioner and our organization for the purpose of preserving, maintaining, or enhancing a state-owned natural resource or portion thereof in accordance with the policies of the Department. Additionally, our agreement permits the Trail Conference, whenever possible, to educate others using the trail(s) on how to hike safely, encouraging them to value open spaces and to treat the land wisely. This proposal contradicts that charge.

The proposed dam, reservoir, powerhouse, pipeline, and subsequent powerlines will significantly and permanently damage the viewshed and trail user experience from multiple hiking trails, including the most popular trails in the Slide Mountain Wilderness and the 360-mile Long Path, which transects the Forest Preserve and connects New York City to the Mohwak River and eventually to the Adirondack Forest Preserve. The pristine scenery of the area is a prime reason for the popularity of the trail network in the Forest Preserve. 

Additionally, the road closures in the proposed pumped storage project eliminate vital access points to popular hiking destinations and recreational resources. By interrupting Route 214, access to the Devil&#39;s Path, Diamond Notch, and Becker Hollow trails are disrupted, as well as the Devil&#39;s Tombstone Campground. By interrupting/obliterating Woodland Valley Road, access to the Burroughs Range, Long Path, and Giant Ledge-Panther Mountain trails are affected, and the Woodland Valley campground is cut off. The elimination of these trailheads will force increased usage in other areas of the Forest Preserve and magnify the negative ecological impacts that we have observed over the past 12 months due to unprecedented visitation on these trails during the pandemic. 

The impacts to these already overwhelmed trailheads and destinations have been identified as a critical issue by Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s Commissioner Basil Seggos. As a result, the Catskill Advisory Group was formed. This group, which the Trail Conference serves on, is charged with creating recommendations and actionable steps to safeguard the Catskills for sustainable recreation. This project would further exacerbate the goals and charge of the Catskill Advisory Group.

The proposed project would also have negative impacts to the natural areas surrounding the trails we are charged with maintaining and protecting. The required powerline right of ways will cross different ecosystems and fragment habitat, lead to the clearing of sensitive vegetation, and create pathways for the spread of invasive species. There is also unnecessary risk of the introduction of invasive species into the Forest Preserve during construction of these facilities, as cited in a Pennsylvania State University study of gas drilling platforms.

The lands and waterways that support the native flora and fauna that are synonymous with the Forest Preserve would be irreversibly damaged and affected by the construction of new dams and reservoirs; the noise pollution from the operation of the facilities would additionally produce undesirable impacts on the trail user experience.

Accordingly, the Trail Conference has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party represents the Trail Conference’s interests, and no other party reasonably could do so. Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion. Considering the concerns mentioned above, the Trail Conference respectfully petitions for intervention.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jane Casey-Meyer under P-15056.

On behalf of Northern Catskills Audubon Society, the 350-member chapter
of the National Audubon Society, and whose chapter territory includes
the area of this proposal, I offer these comments in opposition to the
proposed Ashokan Pumped Energy Storage Project, Docket P-15056.

The proposed project is located within the Catskill Peaks Important Bird
Area (IBA), identified by Audubon New York as one of the largest
contiguous forest tracts in the state. The area was given IBA
designation due to the presence of high-elevation breeding bird species,
such as Bicknell’s Thrush and Blackpoll Warbler, as well as home to the
suite of lower-elevation forest nesting birds. Many of these are
considered species of Special Concern or Threatened in New York State,
or Species of Greatest Conservation Need and include American Black
Duck, Osprey, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawk, Northern
Goshawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, American Woodcock,
Olive-sided Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Scarlet Tanager, Cerulean Warbler,
Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Canada Warbler. In addition to state
protections, Bald Eagle is afforded federal protection under the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Ashokan Reservoir, as part of the
IBA, is an important site for wintering waterfowl and it is unknown how
water depth fluctuations from this project would affect those birds.

Permanent protection of this IBA is of utmost importance to protecting
the aforementioned species. This project, if approved, would fragment
the forest to the detriment of those species, as well as species
currently not identified as in need of protections.

We urge FERC to stop this project before much time and money are
needlessly spent, given that further, detailed negative environmental
effects that will certainly be identified in an EIS if the project is
approved to move to the next step.

Sincerely,

Larry Federman

624 Woodland Valley Road

Phoenicia, NY 12464

April 4, 2021

RE: MOTION TO INTERVENE ON PROJECT # 15056-000, ASHOKAN PUMPED STORAGE
PROJECT

Dear FERC,

I am filing a motion to intervene for proposed project #15056, Ashokan
Pumped Storage Project. I co-own 9.1 acres of property at 624 Woodland
Valley Rd (24.8.1.11), and am a member of Woodland Valley Woods, LLC, 20
acres in size, and Woodland Valley Farm, LLC, approximately 105 acres in
size, which would be inundated by the proposed reservoir in Woodland
Valley associated with the proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

Our family has owned and lived on this property since 1835, making me a
seventh-generation owner of land that would have to be taken away by
imminent domain to be buried forever under water. The property includes
a homestead constructed in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil
War and an original barn built in that era. We have a gravesite on the
property, and numerous family heirlooms from generations of family who
were born on, who served the military during the Civil War, the First
World War and World War II, who worked, and who died on this property.
Our family has invested significant time in collaboration with NYC DEP
to serve as good stewards of the property in its important role in
contributing clean drinking water downstream to New York residents,
including the sale of a 97-acre conservation easement to NYC DEP in 2014
that sacrificed our right to further subdivide and develop much of the
property in perpetuity to help ensure watershed protection. We adopted a
Forest Management Stewardship plan through NYC DEP in 2014 and entered
the Woodland Valley Woods, LLC property into the National Tree Farm
System to ensure best management practices and long-term sustainable
management ensures water quality, wildlife and timber conservation for
future generations. Our family is involved in important American
Chestnut restoration with the New York Chapter of the American Chestnut
Society on the property. I, as well as my family, would therefore be
impacted financially, physically, and on a very real level, spiritually,
from the proposed project #15056.

Not only is this property invaluable to me and my family, the proposed
reservoir construction and operation would generate unacceptable risk to
New York City DEP’s unfiltered water supply downstream in the Ashokan
Reservoir via numerous short-term and long-term impacts. The property
currently serves an important role in maintaining the unfiltered water
supply for New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC
DEP) via its contribution to the high- water quality currently found in
Woodland Valley Creek, its floodplains, and several tributaries and
wetlands located on the property. The proposed reservoir and pumped
storage operation would literally destroy all of these important
hydrological resources. Construction of the reservoir dam, associated
blasting for the dam and connecting underground tunnel, land clearing
and clearcutting to remove standing vegetation beneath the reservoir
pool, and roadbuilding to replace many miles of Woodland Valley Road
would all cause significant fine sediment, turbidity and water quality
impacts to Woodland Creek, Esopus Creek and the Ashokan Reservoir for
many years. But the major water quality impacts would not be limited to
the 5 or more years of construction and disturbance: the daily
fluctuation of the proposed Woodland Valley Reservoir to serve the
pumped storage needs would erode and resuspend fine sediment and
colloidal clay found in numerous naturally-occurring glacial lacustrine
clay deposits throughout the stream, floodplain and valley. The
underlying geology therefore would contribute turbidity to Esopus Creek
and the Ashokan reservoir potentially on a daily basis, causing great
impact and unacceptable risk to New York City’s drinking water supply to
over 9 million people.

The Woodland Creek serves as an important and valued recreational
resource in its current state for me and my family as well. The Woodland
Creek is a storied wild trout fishery, and provides very significant
spawning and rearing habitat for wild brook, brown and rainbow trout
which migrate annually from the Ashokan Reservoir and the Esopus Creek
to use these fertile headwaters to spawn. The proposed reservoir would
eliminate the current fishery within more than 3 miles of Woodland
Creek, it would forever sever the vital connection of more than 13 miles
of coldwater habitat used by trout in the Esopus Creek/Ashokan Reservoir
causing significant impact to this recreationally valuable fishery. If
the proposed project is permitted to be constructed, it would also
degrade the Esopus Creek fishery downstream from altered water
temperature, sediment regime and water quality impacts from the proposed
reservoir construction and operation. Due to the potential negative
effects of the proposed pumped storage reservoir on the Woodland Creek,
Esopus Creek and Ashokan Reservoir and their cherished wild trout
fishery, I am filing as an intervenor as well.

I am vehemently opposed to the project Premium Energy wishes to undertake in the towns of Shandaken and Olive. 

While I understand that energy storage is a critical issue for our region, the Catskills are not the proper location for such a project, and I question the appropriateness of this particular technology. According to my research, the Department of Energy stated in 2013, in a study covering pumped storage technology, that “no energy future was found to bring quantifiable revenues sufficient to cover estimated costs of plant construction.”

My understanding of the technology is that the upper reservoir would be subject to frequent water level changes, a disaster for the rainbow trout fishery that preserves wildlife and forms an important part of the local tourist economy.

This environmentally sensitive area would be adversely impacted by the flooding of valleys. Please do not allow this project to go forward.

Docket No. P-15056 -000  Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

The proposed project by Premium Energy, a California Co, to use the pristine land which is part of the Catskill Forest Preserve and the Ashokan reservoir that is highly protected as part of NYC’s drinking water is nothing but greedy and preposterous. We have owned our second home in Woodland Valley Phoenicia NY, one of the areas directly affected by this proposal for over 30 years. We raised our children and grandchildren to love, respect and always protect the natural wildlife and its abundant nature, as well as the wild streams that flow into the Ashokan and NYC’s drinking water. The proposal infringes on lands that are deemed to be “forever kept as wild forest land” and part of that land also includes the Woodland Valley Campground, est. in the 1930’s one of the oldest in NY and a major tourist attraction. If allowed to go forward the project will also negatively impact tourism which generates significant revenue for the local economy.  There are so many reasons why we passionately object to this irrational project. A project that was submitted to FERC as a “closed loop” project which from what we have learned appears to be quite the contrary.  Please do everything in your power to decline this project as it will ultimately desecrate one of the Catskills most scenic tourist areas with tremendous dams, transmission lines, turbines and tunnels, to possibly store enough energy to supply a small number of homes in the event current grid is overtaxed. The massive costs of this project coupled with the destruction to the ecosystem, drinking water, businesses, people’s lives, livelihoods and wellbeing, is not quantifiable nor well thought out. 
While renewal energy may be important in today’s world surely Premium Energy of Ca could seek out more suitable sites across the country that are barren or rural where a project of this nature would not have a detrimental effect on vital trout waters, an existing community, or clean drinking water.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Mary Huhn under P-15056.

I am a resident of West Shokan, a hamlet in the town of Olive, New York. 

West Shokan, as well as the very road I live on, Moonhaw Road, is one of the towns being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a 300-foot dam, giant reservoir, turbine, and 50-foot tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. There will also be unsightly transmission towers up and down many roads, the mountain and valleys, and along the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies drinking water 40% of water to New York City. A power plant would be built right next to the Ashokan reservoir. 
 
I reject this proposal, object to this proposal and downright am horrified by this proposal, which would negatively impact the environment, destroy communities, upend the homes of many wild creatures great and small. The construction would permanently damage the rivers and streams, and the power plant would disrupt the flow to and increase the turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir, destroy mountains, as well as the quiet beauty of the Catskills, where people have been coming for centuries for respite. I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. Whoever is reading this, please do everything you and your FERC colleagues can do to stop this proposal from going one step further.

Re:  Premiere Energy&#39;s proposition inside the Catskill Park, NY


Dear Secretary Bose:

    I am absolutely shocked that there is even a proposal for an energy project to be constructed inside the Catskill Park in Ulster County NY.  The land proposed for this project is within the “forever wild” forest lands created by New York State in 1885.  According to the NYS constitution  this land can not “be leased, sold, or exchanged, or taken by any corporation public or private.”  Any change to this must be made through constitutional amendment.  This proposal should not even be considered.

Also this project will impact the NYC watershed.  The city receives 40% of its water from the watershed with one of its most important reservoir just miles from the proposed project.  When you live in the watershed putting in a septic system is highly regulated by NYC DEP.  How can something this big and disruptive be considered under these circumstances?

This area of western Ulster County is highly dependent on tourism.  People come here for the pristine beauty of the Catskills as well as to fish in the premiere trout fishing stream, the Esopus.  If this project were to move forward the rapid water fluctuations that would occur would destroy the habitat and breeding grounds of trout.  This project would be a blight on that pristine beauty.

While the town of Olive, where this proposed project would be primarily located, is currently trying to come up with more environmentally friendly ways of supplying energy for our town this proposal is not.  The claim that this is a closed loop project is false.  The plan to have “add on” projects means it is not a closed loop therefore far more detrimental to our environment, in our town, our home.  I can  not believe that this is a project that the Department of Energy would approve as being in line with caring for the environment.

We moved here 40 years ago to live in the mountains and in the Catskill Park.  We do not want to see the beauty of our town, our home destroyed by a company trying to sneak its way into our county.   I hope that you will consider that our current administration ran on caring for the environment and that you will see that this project would jeopardize the forever wild environment of the Catskill Park in Ulster County, town of Olive NY.

I am writing to protest the proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant that would do irreparable damage to the Catskill Forest Preserve and surrounding areas. I am extremely concerned about the impact that this proposal would have on these highly preserved forests, the wildlife and ecosystems therein. Green energy is important and infrastructure always involves trade-offs between individual and public interests, but this proposal does not seem to offer the kind of innovation that would best serve the public in the long term. FERC should deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit, and consider other locations. This proposal is likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and cause
increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for
nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to stop this from moving forward. Thank you.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Richard Lipfert under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/2/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Richard Lipfert, West Shokan, NY.
To Whom It May Concern,
I’m vehemently opposed to project P-15056-000 for the following reasons,
1. The desecration of the natural habitat and wildlife in the path of the proposed reservoir and power lines.
2. The possibility of water wells that can be effected.
3. The effects that this project on the Ashokan Reservoir will have on New York City’s main clean water supply.
4. Damage and changes of town roads that will effect travel due to heavy construction vehicles while construction could last anywhere from 7 to 10 years.
5. This project will stifle tourism and local businesses while removing properties from the current tax base.
6. My wife and I built our home 52 years ago and we raised our children here while tending to the acreage raising farm animals and growing vegetables and being what we considered good stewards of the land. Now in our so called “Golden years” we find ourselves in the position that our home will be uninhabitable due to the proposed 2 power lines/ towers going directly over the rooftop of our house. At the age of 78 we will be uprooted and forced to start a new life God knows where. I would not wish this on anyone! 
Please consider these and many other negative aspects that this project will have on our protected lands.

I am a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County.  I have been a part of the Chichester community all my 78 years; my mother and grandmother have been a part of the community their lives.  Although they are both gone now, my grandmother was one of the first up here and my son and grandchildren are also a part of the community. I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I support our nation’s transition to renewable energy, I believe the Catskills region is not the right location for such a project with significant impacts to state preserved forest land, streams, species, and the New York City water supply. Much of the harm is unlawful and in violation of the New York State Constitution. Further, Premium Energy does not provide the kind of innovation sought by the Department of Energy as its proposal is deficient and misleading. Premium Energy’s claim that it will build a closed loop-system is false.  Closer study indicates their proposal is actually an open loop system, an add-on project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source.  As you know, the environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 

The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve (established 1885). This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Any changes in the management of State Forest Preserves have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum. Otherwise, it is unlawful and unconstitutional.  Consider also the fact that, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report, areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.

I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy’s proposal; and DoE’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

I am strongly opposed to the Proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant in the Catskill Mountains.
My family and I have escaped to the Catskills from NYC and NJ for the past 80 years. The area has been mostly untouched by any major development for most of that time period.
It is still a beautiful area where nature still thrives now as it has for centuries.  This plant would bring environmental devastation.

I currently own a home on the Esopus Creek in Phoenicia.
I understand renewable energy is important but the plan is not good for the Catskills, an area that must be left alone for the reasons I will share below:

According to Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private&#34;.  This proposal violates Article XIV.

The impact on stream ecology from the pumped water would wreak havoc on valuable trout breeding in addition to properties like mine that are on the Esopus Creek.

This project would also pose risks to the NYC water supply which cost billions of dollars of investment; $1.7 billion since the 1990s alone.

This project would also have a major impact on the Catskills tourism economy. Tourism is integral to the NYS economy.  Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskills in 2019. It is a $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Ulster County represents 43% of that market.  And second homes generate $360 million in economic activity of which none want their land taken away due to &#34;eminent domain&#34;. 

Thank you for letting me voice my opinion.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC&#39;s drinking water.

While there&#39;s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country&#39;s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills&#39; most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC&#39;s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy&#39;s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim-it is in fact an &#34;add-on,&#34; and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy&#39;s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain-a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project&#39;s effect on the Catskills&#39; growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy&#39;s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area&#39;s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy&#39;s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be &#34;closed-loop&#34; rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an &#34;add-on,&#34; using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation&#39;s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country&#39;s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project-one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy&#39;s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Dear Secretary Bose,

Please do everything in your power to STOP Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

It is illogical, not to mention incredibly stupid, to use more energy to pump water up to a storage area than one would get when it is released downhill. 

It is immoral to destroy the homes and lives of countless people, fauna and flora in order to create this storage area. It is immoral to violate the Catskill Forest preserve. It is incredibly stupid to build a three-hundred-foot dam in an era when dams are known to cause more harm than good. It is incredibly stupid not to anticipate a catastrophe from a burst dam, which would wreak havoc for years.

decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project
P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, ecology, highly disruptive to local
communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.

Both my residence and work (Menla Mountain Retreat) are located in Woodland Valley, New York. It would be  devastating to the protected forests, streams, wildlife, and the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve if a dam was placed in this area.

While there’s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country’s transition to renewable energy, wild life preserves, ecology, protection of drinking water, communities and businesses must not be sacrificed in the process.

project actually is: an “add-on,” using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir.
This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower
reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation’s largest city. How can we
trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being
fast-tracked for approval?

Our country’s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost
of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to
find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project—one where the
construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable
communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy’s proposal for a preliminary permit
for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

To Whom It May Concern, 

I wish to voice my opposition to the proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings to build a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. Although I agree that sustainable and renewable energy is important, I strongly oppose Project P-15056-000. I believe the Catskill Mountains is not the right place for such an intrusive project, and would have a long-term devastating impact on the environment and community. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams that are part of a Status 1 State Forest Preserve, and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. 

In addition, a long-term project of this kind, with a constant flow of heavy construction vehicles and road restrictions, would deter much relied upon tourism, and cause road congestion for many years for the community.

And lastly, a project of this kind with a massive power line path would cause many homes of established residents to be vacated and possibly leveled. This displacement of families, including my own, who have built and maintained their homesteads over many years, respecting and preserving the surrounding environment, would be absolutely devastating.

In conclusion, I believe the project would be better suited in a location that:

1. Is not a Status 1 State Forest Preserve.
2. An area where an “Add On” reservoir does not pose a serious risk to one of the largest reservoirs providing pristine drinking water to NYC residents, and local wells.
3. Is situated in an area that is not populated by a community of long-term, established residents, who rely on a healthy tourism economy.

West Shokan, NY 12494</pre><hr><b>Comments of Miles T Naughton under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/2/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Miles T Naughton, West Shokan, NY.
To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a pumped storage plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

First of all, I do understand the need for energy storage and that pumped storage can be the preferred option if a proper location is found. A location using a closed-loop system where it would have minimal impact on the environment, wildlife, and communities involved. 

Premium Energy’s open-loop proposal seems to have overlooked these criteria. The three sites they proposed for this project are located in an area that is a delicate balance of highly preserved lands, rich wildlife, and diverse watershed communities.

This project would have severe impacts on highly preserved forests and lands. The Catskill Forest Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. 

The proposed project would wreak havoc on stream ecology and vital trout habitat. Maltby Hollow Brook has some of the highest quality water in the region coming directly form the highest peaks in the Catskills. This area provides suburb spawning grounds for brown, rainbow, and brook trout. The proposed dam would cause rapid fluctuations of water flow which is needed to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Furthermore, a slow-moving or still reservoir would heat up, resulting in abnormal temperature fluctuations which can lead to algal blooms and decreased oxygen levels. Today it is estimated that less than 9% of the areas that historically supported brook trout are intact. 
Native brook trout, which require the highest quality waters, currently thrive in Maltby Hollow brook. Altering the stream ecology here would make this area forever uninhabitable to brook, and all other species of trout. 

New York City has one of the largest and complex unfiltered water systems in the country. Ashokan Reservoir provides 40% of this water. The streams affected in this proposal all provide class A water from the higher peaks and forests down to the Ashokan Reservoir. Diverting water through an open pumped storage system would upset the natural filtration of water coming into the reservoir and likely increase turbidity which would have a negative impact on water quality. Currently, NYC meets its water needs through watershed management and water quality preservation. If NYC were to lose its ability to use unfiltered water due to loss of water quality, the estimated cost to operate a filtration system could exceed one million dollars per day. 

Furthermore, this proposal would have an extreme impact on the watershed communities affected. All three sites would put sections of each community underwater. This includes infrastructure, roads, historic sites, and some of the most pristine homes, estates, and private lands in the region. The remaining sections of each community would be transitioned into a vast flood zone. At time when global warming is making the weather more extreme and the streams flashier and more erratic. 

I think it would be in Prime Energy’s best interest to first do some basic research on a proposed site instead of hastily picking spots from a topo map from thousands of miles away. Prime Energy’s proposal is ill-conceived and unacceptable, and it is my hope that FERC will reject this proposal. 

Thank you for your time.

I grew up in West Shokan, where my maternal ancestors lived since 1792. I currently have a house in Olivebridge. The Ashokan Reservoir is beautiful; it is also the evocative watery grave of Old West Shokan and nine other hamlets in the Towns of Olive and Hurley. Recently nearby “new” Boiceville was carelessly  partially erased due to flood mitigation. The latest lunacy, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, is not needed and is a threat to the public. It would be unsightly. This project is far too much of a risk to a precious resource: drinking water. It was conceived of by secretive opportunistic entrepreneurs from distant states with no appreciation of nor respect for the culture, historic, and ecological significance of the area. West Shokan and the Ashokan are sensitive environmentally. The Catskills have been abused enough; please do not allow it to happen again.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Alex Marshall under P-15056.

It’s an admirable idea to improve sustainable energy   storage and reduce cost. The proposal in question raises several issues — cost,immediate Impact on local communities and long-term amenity.

No cost estimate is included in the proposal, but on the face of it, the amount and nature  of construction must be considerable.

Extensive construction in a remote area — much of it designated wilderness — will cause considerable upheaval to local residents, and reduce attraction to tourists.  The Catskill Park is unique in its unspoiled nature and its accessibility to East Coast population centers.

The final form of the project is unclear, but at the very least there will be new building and transmission lines. The impact on the unique character of the Catskill Park will be permanent. 

Finally, with the best will in the world, there will be some impact on the Ashokan Reservoir, the major supply of water to New York City.   

For these reasons I oppose the proposal

There is no doubt the kind of pumped storage energy systems like that proposed in this application have value in advancing the expansion of renewable energy in the region. 

The issue is that this is not the place in which to site a project that has legal and environmental implications that span local, county, city, and state governments. The most glaring oversight is that this project inevitably disturbs over 100 years of sediment since the Ashokan reservoir was built in 1915.

The construction is one phase of development that impacts water quality in the reservoir. The continuous daily pumping and discharge of water between any new upper holding reservoir and the Ashokan assures that turbidity is permanently elevated in one of the most sensitive trout fisheries in the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Not least of all, affecting drinking water quality for the 9 million customers in New York City, as 40% of its unfiltered drinking water passes through the Ashokan reservoir. The City of New York does not have the capital to construct a filtration system, having for decades relied on the undisturbed nature of the Catskills region to provide that water. It is the largest unfiltered water system in the world.

I write my comment as a farmer and agritourism operator just west of the proposed site. In recent years major bridge construction along the Route 28 corridor served as an impediment to tourists accessing the interior of the Catskill mountains. When guests visit from afar, the last thing they want is to sit in traffic or take long detours to reach their destination for a weekend or holiday trip. The construction of a new dam and proposed infrastructure inevitably places a burden on the local tourist economies. The damage to local tourist economies isn&#39;t off-set in the long-run by the temporary construction jobs that are created.

Lastly, this is not a closed-loop project. It&#39;s an add-on project. The Esopus River flows into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir before meeting the Hudson River. This project directly interacts with a unfiltered public water source. As it is within a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are designated Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” The Dept of Energy&#39;s own materials on hydropower indicate that development of Status 1 or 2 lands should be avoided.

Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by
constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state
legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.

This is the right project in the wrong place. It&#39;s not a simple not-in-my-backyard situation, it seems as if this permit proposal was submitted without any contextual understanding of what water source Premium Energy Holdings wants to use or the land that will be required to implement the project.

Please deny the application for this project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Rebecca Van Kollenburg under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Rebecca Van Kollenburg, PURLING, NY.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I am part of the Catskills community and would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook is where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time, 

Sincerely,
Kristen Edwards</pre><hr><b>Comment of Jasmine Jordaan in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 4/1/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jasmine Jordaan, West Shokan, NY.
Dear FERC Representative,

 

I am writing in my capacity as a concerned property owner in one of the potential dam sites as well as an attorney who has worked for several years for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection working on protecting the watershed through their land acquisition program. The first point that jumps out at me is the huge turbidity threat that this project poses to the New York City drinking water which Services more than 9 million people. Although I see the benefits of hydroelectric power, it is not feasible in our location due to the interests of New York City and the implications of this project interfering with the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Grant of consent for the NYC Filtration Avoidance Program. So not only is there a City issue here there is an interference with a federal agency&#39;s consent. Granting this permit will result in years of litigation with New York City as well as several federal agencies and state agencies. Aside from this monumental hurdle to this project there is several other huge implications such as the fact that the Catskill Park is one of the only national areas with more than 700,000 acres in continuous protection by the state as well as the city (due to the land acquisition program). This protection has been in effect for over 100 years and has resulted in animal and stream habitats that would be directly affected by this project. This project appears to not only create a huge dam but also to require high voltage electric lines to be put in place through protected lands. This is yet one more issue with this project. Also, in reviewing the application there are several misrepresentations a glaring one being that the company is describing this as a closed loop system which is not correct. Ashokan reservoir has the Esopus running into it which clearly is not a closed loop system. From participating in several meetings concerning this project it appears that there is tremendous opposition to this and I hope that you take all these comments into consideration and not Grant this initial permit which will save many hours of taxpayers money since this will trigger tremendous amount of litigation. I&#39;m surprised that this California company has made an application which takes on the entire New York City water supply system. Thank you for your attention to this, Jasmine Jordaan</pre><hr><b>Comments of Parihan Rahman-Porras under P-15056.

Hello,

I am very concerned about this proposed hydro-electric power plant from Premium Energy LLC and I vehemently oppose it. By allowing this to be built you will destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The project would increase turbidity and pollution in the protected Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s drinking water. Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that has ALREADY displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.

​FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA goes directly against New York State Constitution. “ The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed.” – Article XIV, New York State Constitution.  
Reasons to say “NO” to the proposed dam.
- The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index
- As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
- Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the NYC water supply
- The largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, built at the cost of displacing 25 communities
The American people have been stepped on too many times, please do not hurt our mountains any further.
Sincerely,
Camran Hartman</pre><hr><b>Comments of Kathleen Kuhlman under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/1/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kathleen Kuhlman, New York, NY.
This is a very bad idea. Please ensure that New York City is involved in responding to this terrible proposal. In addition to the severe environmental impact to a beautiful wild state-protected area, the ultimate consequences to the water system of the greater New York City area would be profound. It was also very sneaky of the company to make this proposal without informing highly interested parties such as New York City Department of Environmental Protection, not to mention state and local government entities. It is an indication that this company has a severe lack of principles and trustworthiness. Please deny the proposal.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Emily McKenna under P-15056.

In re: P-15056-000, and as someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City.

To whom is may concern:

I am writing to voice my extreme concern about Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP&#39;s application for preliminary permit for document (docket number P-15056-000). I believe this proposed project would be very detrimental for the environment, the community, and Ulster County&#39;s economy. 

Specific concerns include:

1: The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, and this would disrupt this protected land
2: The project would increase turbidity in the Ashokan Watershed and negatively impact NYC’s drinking water
3: The project would be detrimental to our local community by disrupting our economy and displacing residents
4: The destruction of our natural beauty would negatively impact tourism, an important source of positive economic impact for Ulster County

Please do not allow this proposal to move forward.

With kind regards,

This proposal is shocking, outrageous and totally ill considered! And it shows NO knowledge, respect or concern for the Catskills and its people—and NYC. Clean, fresh water is the Catskills greatest resource. Which is why we have fought so hard against fracking—and won! Our tourist industry is dependent on that water, for fishing and so many other recreational activities. In addition, the Catskills has many family farms, and fresh water is crucial for livestock, cows, sheep and increasingly alpacas and horses, and of course, it is also necessary for agriculture. The Catskills are America’s first great wilderness, lost in the 19th century to other irresponsible uses, such as the destruction of the hemlock forests by the tanning industry. Due to protections, such as codifying the Catskill Park as Forever Wild in NYS law (and how does this irresponsible proposal get around THAT?), the Catskills and its waters, which were thoroughly polluted by past egregiousness, have revived. Our streams and rivers offer some of the best fly fishing, as the trout, along with many mountain critters, such as the white-tailed deer and black bear, have returned with our reforested slopes and clean water. Our waters also, and crucially,  supply drinking water to New York City, and the Ashokan Reservoir is the main reservoir whose sweet, clean waters flow to downstate. This project would put that water supply at risk!  And according to one article, the NYDEP, in addition to the Catskill towns concerned, was not even notified? And according to the same article, a Catskill town would be flooded for this? Absolutely not! That happened to too many villages to build the reservoirs. Catskillers, folks native to this area and the many downstaters now increasingly living here—and lots more have moved here due to the pandemic—simply won’t stand for this. This project would alter the hydrology of our local waters, the Esopus Creek, for starters, affect the quality of our water for recreational and drinking uses, both on a personal and commercial level, and also—and just as important—impact our wildlife, which has struggled and finally succeeded in making a comeback here. The Catskills, as anyone making such an irresponsible proposal, soon learns, are home to many committed, passionate and EFFECTIVE grass-roots environmental groups and individuals who will resist any such efforts that would result in compromising in any way our precious natural resources. My vote is a resounding NO!</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion><div class=card><div class=card-header id=headerPDF7><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapsePDF7 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapsePDF7>

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
888 First St. NE, Room 1A 
Washington, D.C. 20426. 

Docket number P-15056-000 


Ms. Bose,

I’m writing regarding Premium Energy Holdings of California’s proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains, including a 300-acre reservoir at one of three sites and a tunnel to bring the water to the east shore of the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir. The three sites are Chichester, Woodland Valley, and the Moonhaw valley in the hamlet of West Shokan, Town of Olive. My comments focus on Moonhaw and West Shokan.  

This construction would impact state land, and as a designated Wilderness Area of the New York State Forest Preserve, the upper reaches of Moonhaw valley are protected from development, per Article XIV of the New York State Constitution.

Also building in these areas would have a devastating impact on tourism in the Catskills, which is integral to the NYS economy, generating 17% of employment in the region in 2019 and providing about 20K jobs, with Ulster County representing 43% of that market and second homes in the area creating $360 million in economic activity.  

Moonhaw is also a community with many homes, valued up to $2.5 million each. This thriving community would be decimated by this construction.

I strongly urge you to recommend that Premium Energy’s proposal be rejected.

Sincerely,

Jenn Wexler</pre><hr><b>Comments of Douglas Kerr under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/30/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Douglas Kerr, Schenectady, NY.
As someone who recreates on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings of Southern California as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for millions of people in both Upstate New York and New York City. If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets in the process. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Michael Dean under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/30/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Michael Dean, Lanesville, NY.
The company seeking the permit have shown zero concern for the people, community and land that the project would impact.  Their assurances that the project would only be undertaken with approval of the community are entirely hollow, evidenced by the complete lack of due diligence done before dropping proposed reservoir sites onto a map.  The applicant clearly did not make even the most basic effort to understand the areas they propose to investigate.  Had they done so, they would have easily realized that their proposal would encroach on legally protected forever wild lands and displace entire hamlets and residential areas.

Rather than requiring the community to go on high alert and rush to defend itself against a poorly though out proposal, perhaps the better path would be for the applicant to construct a proposal that is not completely devoid of basic knowledge, insight on or concern for the local region.  Then having demonstrated that basic level of due diligence, the community could with sufficient time and information, thoughtfully consider and respond taking all the pros and cons into account.

Until then, I ask the FERC to say NO and our elected officials and community to vigorously defend against this proposal.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Melissa A. Rabuffo under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Melissa A. Rabuffo, Chichester, NY.
Project Docket:  P-15056
Melissa Rabuffo, Chichester, N.Y.

As a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County, I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings.  I agree and support the national initiative to increase and transition to renewable energy. It is a necessary goal and objective nationally, as well as worldwide.  I am in support of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reducing the effects of climate change, but this proposal is not the right plan and it does not reflect the right kind of initiative which the Department of Energy should approve.   

This portion of the Catskill region, and all three proposed sites, are not the right location for this project due to its incredible impact to state preserved forest land, streams, and the New York City Water Supply.  It is also unlawful and in direct violation of the New York State Constitution and puts in question using public land for private gain. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Any changes to the land management in the State Forest Preserve must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, and then submitted to the public in a referendum.  For that reason alone, this proposal misunderstands or does not take into account the logistical issues of such a project. 

The proposal itself is full of inaccuracies and lack of diligence which makes one suspect the Premium’s ability and basic understanding of scope to engage in this endeavor. The proposal claims that it is a closed-loop system, yet it is connecting to the Ashokan Reservoir. The Esopus Creek and other streams connect to the Ashokan Reservoir so in effect this is an open-loop system.  The Department of Energy encourages the use of close-loop systems, but not open-loop systems.  In addition, Premium Energy did not inform the various stakeholders and communities that could be impacted for comment. 

As the largest national preserve closest to New York City, as well as supplying 40% of its drinking water, the amount of protest and concern would be overwhelming. There are also legitimate concerns about how this open-loop system would impact turbidity and water quality for over 9 million residents in New York City.  

Environmentally, the Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County and is 700,00 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasing fragmented environment.  The proposed reservoir falls within the Audubon Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area.  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program”.  According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

As it stands, there is strong opposition from all represented parties locally including townships, conservation groups, business owners, as well as an involved and invested residents and visitors.   Phoenicia, which is the largest town in this area,  is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Catskill Mountains.  Phoenicia is rated as one of the Top Ten Small Towns in America (Budget Travel Magazine). It also has been ranked as the #1 destination outside of NYC.  The amount of people who are moving to or trying to live her full time in the last year is astounding.  The local and regional resistance to taking land from existing home owners or potential homeowners would be a political nightmare and a public relations disaster for Premium.  

Historically, this is an area which was flooded 100 years ago to create the Ashokan Reservoir and displaced 22 townships.  There continues to be historical trauma and outrage in this area which is significant to this day.  Our area is filled with brown signs along our roads declaring Former Site of West Shokan, Olivebridge, Ashokan, and Shokan, as well as towns which no longer exist such as Brown’s Station.   The residents and those who love the Catskills would vehemently oppose this happening again in this area. 

Due to the Catskill Forest being a protected preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, the misleading and inaccuracies of the Premium Energy proposal, the direct threat to NY City drinking water and environmental impact, and strong public opposition, are all key reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I am part of the Catskills community that would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056:000. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 
First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

I live on Moonhaw Road, one of the locations under consideration. The end of our road, where one of the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 
In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats.  Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 
I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time, 

Sincerely,
Bushra Rehman</pre><hr><b>Comments of Tibet House US / dba Menla Mountain Retreat under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Tibet House US / dba Menla Mountain Retreat, Phoenicia, NY.

We are a tourist attraction, and this unsightly project would negatively impact tourism in our town. Also, years ago we did a large study on the local ecology in our valley, and our property and surrounding area are home to several endangered species of birds (including the eastern hellbender and the Bicknell&#39;s Thrush), a rare sanctuary to hundreds of species of lichen, in addition to providing habitats for rabbits, foxes, deer, turkeys, coyotes, fisher cats, bears, and even mountain lions, among other species.

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, disrupt the local ecosystem, and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Basis for Intervening:
Theodore Gordon Flyfisher, Inc, (TGF) is a not-for-profit angling organization committed to stream and river protection and the preservation of wild trout populations in the Catskills.  If approved, the proposed project will impact the quality of the water of the Esopus and its tributaries.  TGF moves to be made an Intervenor in these proceedings to represent its members, who have a vital interest in the protection of these rivers and streams.  TGF’s members are avid anglers that live in the Northeast and frequently fish in the Esopus and its tributaries.

Since its founding in 1963, TGF’s singular mission has been to preserve the habitat of wild trout populations, including the native brook trout in New York State.  The locations of any of the three dams proposed for the project will eliminate or severely restrict the flow of water in a tributary to the Esopus river.  Each of those tributaries provide critical spawning habitat for wild and nativized trout, including native brook trout.  Reducing spawning habitat will impact the population of wild trout in the river system and degrade the quality of the river system that TGF members use for recreation.  

TGF members are intimately familiar with the condition of these streams.  Many of them have spent a lifetime fishing these waters. On behalf of its members, TGF successfully sued the City of New York under the Clean Water Act to require the City to monitor and reduce turbidity of water the city released into the Esopus.  See Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. City of New York, 451 F.3d 77, 62 ERC 1737 (2d Cir. 2006).  Through its continued efforts to advocate for the protection of the Esopus, TGF’s directors and members have gained a deep understanding of the river system and can provide a unique perspective to the proceedings.   

TGF works hard to keep its members informed of conservation issues that effect the cold-water fisheries around the Northeast, including the Esopus watershed.

Basis for Intervening: 
The Woodland Community Association represents the home and property owners of Woodland Valley who have an interest in the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the Commission by Premium Energy for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056). The proposed reservoir in Woodland Valley would either flood, or cut off access to, almost all of 200&#43; homes in Woodland Valley. Accordingly, the Woodland Valley residents have a primary and vital interest in this matter. We seek to become a party to this proceeding to insure that the interests of the residents are properly represented. 

Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion. In light of the foregoing, the Woodland Community Association respectfully petitions for intervener status.

Proposed site is inappropriate for pumped storage and will not efficiently use funds to provide maximum peak storage capacity.

Pumped storage projects usually use ‘cleaned’ / lined reservoirs on vacant land, like Blenheim – Gilboa, to ensure water quality.  Proposed reservoirs would be created in heavily occupied areas including abandoned &amp; lost septic systems, congregate &amp; private dumps, lead &amp; asbestos in most buildings.  Areas are covered in dense forest.  Remediation necessary for removing and disposing of contamination would be very costly.

Pumped storage projects rely on NATRUAL elevation differences, low bermed reservoirs to minimize costs &amp; transport of massive quantities of concrete &amp; reinforcing for high dams with far less requirements for in depth foundations, as well as far less problems with silt, debris, &amp; and other contaminated construction run off. 

Bedrock depth varies up to and over 500 feet in place.  Soil column contains strata’s of artesian springs, voids, quick sands, clays, rock etc. This needs removal, shoring, dewatering to blast foundations into bedrock.  Anything less risks dams failure which would kill thousands living clustered along stream banks &amp; render the Ashokan Reservoir providing water for 10 million, contaminated, useless

Interrupting aquifers that travel along valley bottoms, wells for all buildings down stream are at risk, failure will require yet more property acquisition.

Construction of MASSIVE dams will require MASSIVE amounts of trucked in material over a SINGLE TWO LANE ROAD.  Such loading will beat the highways to rubble &amp; will probably wear out all but the 2 main highway bridges.  HUNDREDS of trucks a day will spew mammoth amounts of pollution to the many buildings close to the roads.  Vibrations will lead to damage to many.

Areas are fully occupied with homes lining roads.  Roads in subject areas are critical access roads to other areas with limited access. Electrical power to subject valleys is from one end only and this project would leave stranded all properties not flooded from both power and access requiring their acquisition also.

Proposed dams are inappropriate for pumped storage projects ESPECIALLY as part of a municipal water supply system for over 10 million people, as they will CERTIANLY lead to extensive construction contamination followed by even more contamination from reservoirs filled with remains of if not actual hundreds of thousands of trees, asphalt highways, drives etc.  Acquisition costs alone will exceed ½ billion dollars unless owners are paid LESS than what they’ll need to buy homes in the area, close to family, friends and jobs. Remediation of constructed environment will cost hundreds of millions including digging up dozens of acres of abandoned dumps along with the soil sewerage and garbage wastes percolated into.  Tens of millions will be needed for the removal of trees and other bio mass and stabilization of the bared forest floors to prevent their quick erosion from creating an ecological disaster.  The project will also need to reimburse NYS tens of millions for repeated road reconstruction and bridge replacements as it’s hundreds of trucks a day destroy them.  The project will need to reimburse tens of millions more to hundreds, thousands of property owners from vibration damage to homes often yards from roads, &amp; to businesses for loss of income from truck, fume, and dust choked roads and hundreds of millions for tourism businesses for permanent reduction of business.

Furthermore, the proposal to site the generation facility in massive caverns deep under ground with miles of associated access, air, and water tunnels up to 50 feet wide, through loose fills saturated with water to solid bedrock will create the most expensive generator building in the US.  As being located and connected to and BELOW the level of the Ashokan Reservoir any failure of dewatering pumps will risk the contamination of the reservoir with tons of lubricants &amp; chemicals needed to maintain generators &amp; building, along with leachate from plastics and chemicals embedded in the generator building itself.  

These issues, along with the work being performed in the most costly construction market in the US, subject to approval by NYS and NYC Building Codes as well as NYS and NYC DEP regulations and approval PLUS Federal Oversight to ensure water quality remains unaffected by the work or operations will be the most expensive hydro power project every attempted in the US and no doubt the most expensive pumped storage project in the world.

For the BILLIONS it would take to realize this projects full potential similar capacity of liquified compressed air off peak storage as is being installed on remote islands could be located nearest power hungry areas, thus saving on transmission system costs and transmission losses.

The application is a virtual cut and paste of prior applications down to facility size, power house location, and the most dubious and vague construction methodologies.

The applicant has also been reported to have made ignorant if not misleading statements, indicating the firm is working at the request of PSEG Long Island to provide peak power for LI.  All transmission lines feeding NYC &amp; LI are maxed out on peak days.  The very time the energy would be most needed, the facility would need to sit idle.  (Ashokan-Plant_Hudson-Valley-One.pdf (shandaken-ny.com))  The applicant also states that as engineer they have no interest in the project, despite 5 million dollar cost of report nearly DOUBLING yearly billing.

The above indicates an inability of applicant to perform to a minimum standard of veracity care and due diligence VITAL in the construction of SIGNIFICANT dams and infrastructure, inability of same to design facility to produce power at economical price to consumers, and inability to care for the water supply of over 10 million people, and should require the immediate rejection of this application.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Morgan Lyle under P-15056.

I write to ask the Commission to reject P-15056, the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to construct a pumped storage facility in the Esopus Creek watershed in New York.

As a resident of New York City, I find the potential for damage to the city’s drinking water supply completely unacceptable. As a native of Ulster County, I am appalled by the idea of burying any of the three communities and locales cited in the proposal, each of which I have visited whenever possible throughout my lifetime. And as an avid angler, I can scarcely believe that anyone in the 21st century would suggest destroying the habitats of heritage-strain brook trout and wild, self-sustaining rainbow trout. The project would be very damaging to the outdoor recreation industry that is so important to the area.

I am a strong supporter of renewable energy, but this proposal is a terrible idea. Again, I ask you to reject it.

Morgan Lyle</pre><hr><b>Comments of Steve Golden under P-15056 Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Steve Golden, Olivebridge, NY.
On behalf of Golden Woodlands, LLC, I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy Holding’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. My family has been a landowner in Olivebridge, NY since 1950, and the third generation of our family currently lives on our property.  Golden Woodlands, LLC, the land holding entity for the family is adamantly opposed to the highly destructive proposal submitted to FERC by Premium Energy Holdings.  We will collaborate with others opposing this project until it is defeated, no matter how long it takes.  We have very deep roots in the community and will actively oppose this proposal which will drastically impact the area’s ecology, landscape, economy, and detrimentally impact the NYC water supply.

The Town of Olive is the wrong place for a project of this type.  The community, which still harbors some resentment from its relocation due to the construction of Ashokan Reservoir has contributed substantially to the public welfare of the State and region.  Bound by forever wild lands of NYS Department of Environmental Conservation in the Catskill Forest Preserve, and highly protected lands within the NYC Department of Environmental Protection Watershed, its resource base is already limited and cannot afford to be severed by an additional reservoir and lengthy transmission lands.  

A project of this type should only be located closer to a population center and existing transmission facilities, so as to more efficiently utilize the energy savings created.
It appears that the transmission lines for this proposal will cross property owned by Golden Woodlands.  We guarantee the applicant will have to use eminent domain to acquire any of our holdings and we will fight at each step of the process placing every legal obstacle in the way.  Several of our neighbors have all agreed to make a concerted effort to challenge any access to the property along the route shown on the preliminary map.

We will insist that the applicant submit a full environmental impact statement and analysis of alternatives sites considered.  It is also our understanding that the reservoir sites and transmission lines identified potentially impact species of special concern including both plants and animals and that the US Fish and Wildlife Service needs to thoroughly investigate all potential impacts in the entire watershed.  

The Ashokan Reservoir is a engineering achievement of extraordinary national historic and cultural value and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic sites and merits protection of its entire infrastructure including the quarries and roads which were used in its construction.  A detailed historical survey must be completed for planning to proceed.  

Finally, the economy of the southern Catskills will be drastically impacted by a project of this magnitude, and a comprehensive assessment of its economic impact is essential.  It is likely that the negative impact on the region’s value as a world class fishery, its historically notable landscapes painted by the Hudson River School of Painters, and written of by notable early conservationists like John Burroughs, the popular Catskill hiking trails in the area, and extraordinary opportunities on and off-road biking must be accounted for.  It seems likely that far more value will be lost than that created by the pump storage project.

Please stop this project and decline a preliminary permit now rather than create the long-term disruption and cost it will inevitable create with very uncertain outcome.  Simply this is the wrong place for this type of project.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion></div></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header9><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse9 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse9>

FERC Docket # P-15056

I own a home on Stony Clove Lane in Chichester, NY.  I am writing in opposition to the granting of a preliminary permit, now under consideration, to Premium Energy Holdings (FERC Docket # P-15056.

The company claims that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the Catskills Forest Preserve.  But a study of the proposed sites shows that they are within the Preserve - which was established in 1885 by the New York State Constitution.  A constitutional amendment would be required to change the use of lands meant to be kept forever as wild lands.

The company also claims that this would be a closed loop system - but a review reveals that it would be an open loop system which would affect the Stony Clove and Woodland Valley Creeks.  It would also negatively affect the Ashokan Reservoir, proposed as the lower reservoir and the source of 40% of New York City’s drinking water, with turbidity due to fluctuations of pumped water.

I understand, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program and therefore are to be avoided for development.   Damage will be done to wildlife habitat, including protected species.

For all the above reasons I urge you to deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit.

Sincerely yours,

RE: The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

We all know time goes on and takes technology with it. But one has to weigh the positive and negative impact of technology on those who it interacts with.

Do we want to flood areas of our community where folks lived and have lived for decades? No!
Do we want to relocate families? No!
Do we want high voltage power lines running right past our house? No!

What are the positives of this plan? That Central Hudson can generate more electricity during the off peak hours to use during peak time? That the company involved putting this all together can make a lot of money doing it?

What are the negatives? Many, many families will be impacted. Their entire lives will have to change. Their serene existence in the Hudson Valley, in the Catskill Mountains will be disrupted. Many will be exposed to the - not disproven - health effects of power lines. Property values will go down for all near those lines. 

We don’t want it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Virginia Workstus under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/30/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Virginia Workstus, Olivebridge, NY.

Re: FERC project proposal by Premium Energy Holdings 
subdocket # P-15056-000


I have lived full time in Olivebridge, NY for the past 20 years. I want to share my opinion to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a large dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. I oppose this proposed project.

This proposed project is intrusive and will negatively impact the ecology of the Catskill Forrest Preserve, which is protected by the New York State Constitution.  This project is likely to uproot area residents, damage or relocate local roads, damage local lands and streams and cause increased turbidity in waters which are a part of the watershed serving New York City’s unfiltered drinking water system.

This project will be a net consumer of energy, meaning that cheap power will be spent to make more expensive power.  This is short sighted and does not support responsible development of green energy production, which I do support. 

The Ashokan watershed has endured and continues to endure environmental stress.  The local ecosystem faces ongoing challenges to its health.  Pumped storage systems such as the one proposed creates rapid water level fluctuations of the upper reservoir.  These “wreak havoc on ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and fresh water ecosystems overlap.”  

I understand that infrastructure projects like this one often involves trade-offs between the negative impacts and positive good.  The Catskill Preserve and surrounding wilderness areas support the local economies of area towns and individuals.  The current New York City reservoir system sacrificed 33 towns, displacing thousands of residents.  Many area communities such as Olivebridge continue to struggle to survive and depend on tourist dollars.  This proposed project will stress already stressed communities.

This area is not the best suited place to build this proposed system.  Please work to prevent this proposal from moving forward.  Thank you.

Dear Ms. Bose,

This letter is concerning docket #P-15056-000.

I am writing to express my support for renewable energy, but my opposition to this plan in particular. Premium Energy (PE) has clearly given little to no consideration to the area that they are proposing to build this hydropower dam. 

There are a number of flaws in PE’s proposal. The first being that PE is calling the Ashokan Pumped Storage plan a “closed-loop” system. This is blatantly false. The proposed upper reservoir would rely on the lower reservoir (the current Ashokan reservoir) as a water source. This makes the plan patently an “open-loop” plan.

Number two. The Ashokan reservoir, which PE’s proposed plan will rely heavily on, is an integral and majority resource in NYC’s water supply. The Ashokan provides around 40% of the water supply to New York City’s over 9 million residents. Allowing PE’s plan to go forward would mean increased turbidity and sediment to the Ashokan, not to mention possible risk to overall supply. As climate change continues to affect our world, it’s impossible to know whether the levels of the Ashokan will remain stable in the coming years. 

Thirdly, tt seems with willful ignorance, that Premium Energy has chosen one of this region’s largest continuous wildlife preserves, under the protection of the New York Constitution, as the locale for a hydroplant designed to supply backup power.The sites in question are home to numerous under-threat and endangered species, including the:

	•	Cooper’s hawk
	•	Red-shouldered hawk
	•	Sharp-shinned hawk
	•	Eastern hognose snake
	•	Timber rattlesnake


Premium Energy’s proposal claims the hydroplant would generate 2,800 mega watts of power, but would require 2,000 mw of that power just to operate the plant itself. This equation does not make a strong case for the sacrifice of hundreds of acres of protected wildlife habitat to be wiped out.

I thank you in advance for considering the above points. Again, renewable energy is an important part of our future, and one that I value. However, this plan from Premium Energy is not sound, and should not be allowed to move forward.


Sincerely,

Krishna Fitzpatrick

I am opposed to the project plan in docket P-15056.  This is the wrong kind of plan for my home area. While I am supportive of alternative energy projects, and recognize that trade-offs are almost always part of energy advancement, this plan has so little energy gain it is not worth the costs and risks. The areas that would be impacted are highly preserved land, and there will be devastating impact to preserved land and streams. Preservation has been hard won over many years, and this plan will undo those gains in a number of areas.  Also, we are going to see a parade of legal ramifications and entanglements emerge if this plan moves forward; I will join them and encourage my neighbors to join them, because they are justified in challenging this wrong approach by Premium Energy. This project impacts wildlife, local tourism and historical preservation, including for Native American history.  The Catskills Preserve in my county of Ulster has been working for over 135 years, and under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution the wording states that the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills hold Status 1 land designation under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Department. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision: “Areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

My name is George Kraemer (52 Old Farm Road, Shokan, NY 12481), and I submit here my comments on the pumped storage hydro plant proposed for locations adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir (FERC project number P-15056, sub-docket number P-15056:000).

I understand and applaud the commitment to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the proposed pumped storage project has numerous negatives, based on location and environmental impact.  These negatives far outweigh the benefits gained by the project.  

Pumped storage reservoirs are environmentally detrimental.  The recently discovered phenomenon of methane emission from anoxic bottom sediments negates much of the switch from fossil fuel combustion to renewable sources.  Methane has ca. 25-times the potential for global warming of carbon dioxide. 

The Department of Energy’s Mission Innovation initiative has as its mission the research and development of clean energy.  Pumped storage is a net consumer of energy.  It is also relatively inefficient, requiring massive volumes of pumped water to store significant energy.  An environmentally better alternative is demand side management of electricity demand to reduce the need for pumped storage.  Pumped storage fails to be either innovative or clean.  

Ecologically, the rapid fluctuations of the water level in pumped storage prevent the development of a diverse, functional community.  Additionally, seasonal discharges of excess water from the proposed upper reservoir will seriously alter the hydraulics of the local creeks, incising stream beds and removing finer sediments and substrates, resulting in loss of biological integrity; the creeks will no longer be functioning parts of the biological landscape, but rather simply canals to release unneeded water.  These sediments will be transported into the Ashokan Reservoir, degrading the water quality of a major (40%) supplier of drinking water to New York City.  

New York State has long recognized the value of conserving wild lands, having the strongest “forever wild” clause of any state’s Constitution.  This 1894 clause directs that state-owned Catskill lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Whether New York State legislators of 125 years ago knew it or not, conservation of undisturbed wild land is key to the ecological integrity of the whole; many forest fragments do not add up to the same ecological entity as an intact forest.

Summarized succinctly, while the grid may need additional energy storage, and pumped storage is one means of achieving that, the proposed locations simply poor choices.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ana Silva under P-15056.

Concerning docket P-15056:000
  I’m writing in opposition to the proposal for a pumped storage hydro project in the Catskills Forest Preserve. As a resident of West Shokan and also as a consumer of New York City drinking water, I believe this is not an appropriate choice of site. Having seen parts of the proposal, it strikes me that your company has not considered many of the essential aspects of this region that make it a terrible location. 
  Under the NYS constitution, Article XIV, the Catskills forests “shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”. Indeed, this area is pristine Status 1 preserve. It shall be forever kept as wild forest lands”.
  Aside from the huge disruption to and destruction of ecosystems, small roadways and homes and impact on local tourism, the potential for silty runoff into the NYC water system is cause enough for this project to be moved elsewhere. Please let us keep the Catskills as pristine forest lands. 
   Thank you.

To whom it may concern, 

As a long time residents of West Shokan in Olive New York, We strongly object to the proposed hydroelectric plant, penstock and pumped storage reservoir proposed for our area. We feel that the proposed project would be destructive to our community and fundamentally change our way of life. It&#39;s construction would be disruptive and the associated infrastructure would scar the land in an otherwise pristine landscape that is enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. 

Please consider using another location for the proposed project!

This comment is written by a full time resident of the reservoir area on 3/31/21.  I’m Susanna Nicholson, at 170 Chase Rd. Shokan NY 12481.

Our area is a recreational jewel, an absolutely essential animal habitat.  Shokan also features a critical resource for the security and health of our state:  the Ashokan Reservoir, serving millions of NY State residents with clean, beautiful mountain water.

The assaults on natural habitat and water quality have never had more serious consequences than now, a time when water is truly an endangered resource nationwide.  Siting two powerhouses on the reservoir threatens our clean water, especially as the heat index already rises annually with climate change, and aquatic plant growth increases with CO2.  

Let’s pause here to remind ourselves that NY State has committed to renewable energy growth *with restrictions* as part of “Governor Cuomo’s Nation-Leading Climate Agenda”: “[projects will be] … responsibly permitted, bolster the state’s economy, and deliver health, environmental, and economic benefits to all New Yorkers.”  And I would like to draw your attention to one of the signal responsibilities of the Renewable Energy Siting Office:

“[to] achieve a net conservation benefit to any impacted endangered and threatened species.”

That is simply not possible with this project: the destruction of numerous woodland habitats through demolition and dams, the loss of recreational revenue and natural beauty, and the changing temperatures, pH, and soil content in important wetlands and estuaries downstream of the proposed dams and powerhouse.  The health and environmental aspects could not be worse.  If anyone imagines this enhances the quality of water arriving to NYC, I’d like to see the evidence.

Our future energy needs will be more efficiently met with other sources. I think we should wait to see what the Biden infrastructure plan offers our state in terms of federal funding for renewables such as solar and wind.  Our county has proven especially hospitable to solar projects, and those would be more consistent with existing land use patterns.

Also:

Why have we banned fracking in NY if we’re going to allow this Rube-Goldberg, comically-complex scheme of new reservoirs, dams, and powerhouses, privately run by out-of-state speculators?  

Given the complexity of this project, the environmental impact review process alone will run the state into the millions, or it will be shortchanged to expedite matters, with profound costs to the quality of life in Ulster and downstate counties.  There will be an extraordinary amount of litigation … all for an obviously inefficient project with catastrophic implications for NY State wildlife and forest.  

The required deforestation also seems ill-timed given our state’s priorities on climate change.

The Catskills are one of the things that make life in NY with its high taxes and demanding regulatory structures, really worthwhile for ALL of us.   Don’t ruin it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Nivo Rovedo under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Nivo Rovedo, Lagrangeville, NY.
My comment is in regards to the project known to FERC by docket number P-15056, the Ashokan Reservoir pumped storage project. Premium Energy Holdings 
(PEH) has requested a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study a pumped storage project on New York City’s Ashokan Reservoir. As a resident nearby the Catskill region,  I am against permitting this. My reason has to do with the location of this proposal and the significant adverse impacts it would have on water quality, the environment, and local Ulster County economy to name but a few effects. I am generally very much in favor of renewable energy storage projects, but this one is ill-conceived and can do incredible damage to the water supply of many towns, including New York City, and to the  environment.
  PEH requested the FERC permit without consulting with New York City (NYC); NYC’s Department of Environmental Protection had no prior knowledge of this proposal. This is crucially important because millions of people depend on the Ashokan Reservoir for drinking water, in New York City and many communities north of the city. We cannot afford to damage this precious, essential resource in any way! I feel that PEH, being a California based developer, is not familiar with how crucial and sensitive this body of water is to the region.
   As part of NYC’s water supply system, the Ashokan meets approximately forty percent of the City’s water needs, plus supplies water for some twenty communities as it travels south.  This water is currently unfiltered. The Ashokanis the oldest of NYC’s six Catskill water supply impoundments and the second largest.  But it is the only NYC Catskill reservoir that was constructed with two separate basins, an east and west basin.  The upper, or west basin, was constructed to serve as a settling basin allowing the periodic turbid reservoir inflows to settle out.  Since the reservoir’s construction in 1915, over one hundred years of sedimentation have settled in the west basin, where Premium Energy Holdings seeks to construct its pumped storage facility.The pumping and releasing of water from and into the Ashokan would potentially keep water turbid, thus negatively affecting its drinking quality, if not filtered.
   Additionally, the action of the pumped storage project would disrupt the reservoir’s thermocline. The Ashokan currently is a two-story reservoir that stratifies into a warm layer top and cold-water bottom during part of the year.  As such, it supports a healthy population of wild rainbow and brown trout.  Rainbow trout, which the Esopus Creek is best known for, are sight feeders that fed on zooplankton.  Zooplankton require clear water to thrive.  Thus, operation of a pumped storage project could create a constant turbid state, adversely impacting both zooplankton and the rainbow trout population.  And loss of the cold-water regime would further negatively impact the reservoir’s trout population. 
   For decades the Ashokan Reservoir-Esopus Creek connection of spawning rainbows and browns, running out of the reservoir, upstream into the Esopus to reproduce, has been much written about and heartily pursued.  In fact, the Esopus Creek wild trout fishery is dependent upon spawning trout from NYC’s Ashokan Reservoir.  Under a recently revised NYS Trout Management Plan the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) recognized the significance of the Esopus Creek trout fishery, classifying the river as Wild-Quality AND all its tributaries as Wild, that is to say, there is more than adequate spawning of wild trout to maintain these fisheries.  These are classifications very few NYS streams attain, and a recognition of the intrinsic value of these waters.If allowed to proceed, the proposed project would impact the watershed trout fishery: the Ashokan, Esopus, and tributaries where trout spawn.
   In addition, a major issue is that portions of the upper reservoirs would be constructed on NYS Forest Preserve lands; this would be a direct violation of the NYS Constitution.  While all of the aforementioned are environmental impacts, they are also economic impacts to Ulster County.  Much of the Ulster County economy is recreation based, with angling an important contributor.  Additionally, communities along the Esopus Creek, downstream of NYC’s Ashokan Reservoir have long since raised concerns about turbid discharges from the water supply.  These concerns can only be exacerbated if this project goes forward.
    Clearly this project is an ill-convinced idea by a west-coast based company with little knowledge, nor care, to impacts caused to the water quality, environment, economy, history, and general well-being of people living in the general area of this proposed endeavor.
     Please reject this permit request for all the reasons above.
    Thank you.
Nivo Rovedo</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lynne Sherbondy under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lynne Sherbondy, West Shokan, NY.
I am a resident of West Shokan in the Town of Olive in Ulster County, NY.

The preliminary permit application, entitled The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, currently before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)includes building a large dammed reservoir in a New York State forest, an underground hydropower plant in West Shokan, and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the Town of Ulster. If allowed to proceed, this project will have enormous detrimental impact on our community. 

I am opposed to The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for three reasons:

1. The Premium Energy proposal is not the kind of innovation the Department of Energy (DoE) wants.
   • Premium Energy is proposing an open-looped pumped-storage hydropower project where the lower reservoir will be continuously connected to a naturally flowing upper reservoir. Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. 
   • Premium Energy is claiming this to be a “closed-loop.” It is not. Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects. That is what this project is. Premium Energy is lying. 
   • “Initial construction impacts” for open-loop projects are lower, but “operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the add-on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.” (Source: DoE: “A Comparison of the Env. Effects of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower.” April 2020)

2. Impact on highly preserved land
   • The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the DoE’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
     o Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
     o The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 
     o All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area. 
   • Premium Energy appears to be completely unaware that they are proposing a project in an extremely protected state preserve, a Status 1 area according to the USGS Gap Analysis. Change in the State Forest Preserve is rare:
      o Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. 
      o As of 1999, more than 2,000 amendments have been proposed. Only 29 made it to the referendum stage; of those, 20 passed. 
      o Source: The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line 

3. Impact on stream ecology 
   • Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. 
   • Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the New York City water supply.
   • A valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

proposal is shocking, outrageous and totally ill considered! And it shows NO knowledge, respect or concern for the Catskills and its people—and NYC. Clean, fresh water is the Catskills greatest resource. Which is why we have fought so hard against fracking—and won! Our tourist industry is dependent on that water, for fishing and so many other recreational activities. In addition, the Catskills has many family farms, and fresh water is crucial for livestock, cows, sheep and increasingly horses, and of course, it is also necessary for agriculture. The Catskills are America’s first great wilderness, lost in the 19th century to other irresponsible uses, such as the destruction of the hemlock forests by the tanning industry. Due to protections, such as codifying the Catskill Park as Forever Wild in NYS law (and how does this irresponsible proposal get around THAT?), the Catskills and its waters, which were thoroughly polluted by past egregiousness, have revived. Our streams and rivers offer some of the best fly fishing, as the trout, along with many mountain critters, such as the white-tailed deer and black bear, have returned with our reforested slopes and clean water.. Our waters also, and crucially,  supply drinking water to New York City, and the Ashokan Reservoir is the main reservoir whose sweet, clean waters flow to downstate. This project would put that water supply at risk!  And according to one article, the DEP, in addition to the Catskill towns concerned, was not even notified? And according to the same article, a Catskill town would be flooded for this? Absolutely not! That happened to too many villages to build the reservoirs. Catskillers, folks native to this area and the many downstaters now increasingly living here—and lots more have moved here due to the pandemic—simply won’t stand for this. This project would alter the hydrology of our local waters, the Esopus Creek, for starters, affect the quality of our water for recreational and drinking uses, both on a personal and commercial level, and also—and just as important—impact our wildlife, which has struggled and finally succeeded in making a comeback here. The Catskills, as anyone making such an irresponsible proposal, soon learns, are home to many committed, passionate and EFFECTIVE grass-roots environmental groups and individuals who will resist any such efforts that would result in compromising in any way our precious natural resources. My vote is a resounding NO!

I was disturbed to learn of the recently proposed hydroelectric overhaul of the region by Premium Energy Holdings. Residents of the Catskills are keenly aware of our area&#39;s past exploitation, and to have a company propose continuing that tradition is the antithesis of what we stand for.

I am also fully aware of how easy it would be for these concerns to be dismissed as knee-jerk, or based on an incomplete understanding of the project. So instead I&#39;ll approach it with the objective question: would such a project produce more good or more harm? 


From what information is available, the good seems pretty minimal: 

-Premium Energy Holdings employs and shareholders will see a benefit.
-Such projects can contribute to reducing our overall dependence on fossil fuels. (However any climate-change gains may be undercut by the energy and resources required for production and operation.)


Meanwhile the harm caused by such a project seems far greater:

-Permanent alteration and destruction of the regions water systems.  I&#39;ve seen first-hand how even year-to-year changes in rainfall have had drastic impacts on our local streams, ponds, rivers, and overall watershed: recurring summer dry spells have meant even existing reservoirs have been dangerously low, as has the water table we rely on for our home wells. This is the time for us to be working to preserve our water sources, not altering them further. As others have brought up, this issue affect not just the Catskills region but New York City itself, which relies on our existing reservoirs for its water supply.

-Displacement of and negative impact on the region&#39;s peoples. This project will inevitably lead to people&#39;s homes being destroyed. This is something we have been through before with the construction of the existing Ashokan reservoir, a time we do not look back on fondly. In addition such a project will affect every resident&#39;s ability to travel, as well as potentially damage the tourism industry that sustain towns from Woodstock to Phonecia to Hunter. 

-Massive losses to and displacement of wildlife. The Catskills are a unique oasis for flora and fauna that are otherwise struggling from climate change and human development. As mentioned before, it wasn&#39;t too long ago that most this area was clear-cut. Thanks to state protections our natural areas are finally beginning to return to their former glory- to the benefit of us all. To flood these areas and cut down acres of forest for powerlines and pipelines would be to undo all that progress.  

So it is for all these reasons that I believe a project of this nature would objectively be a detriment to the region, and I hope that Premium Energy Holdings will take this into consideration going forward.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am contacting you in regards to the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal (P-15056). This proposal was developed by the private electric company Premium Energy, based in California, and involves the construction of a for-profit hydroelectric dam in Olive, Woodland, or Lanesville. The proposed dam would reach up to 300 feet and connect to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel drilled under public and private land. This dam would be problematic for numerous reasons.

The dam would need to flood at least 200 acres to construct a new reservoir, which would negatively impact the ecology of the Catskills Forest Preserve, which is protected by the NY State Constitution. This would reduce the amount of recreational area available for hikers, and it would also endangered several threatened species.  Moreover, the dam would reduce the quality of New York City’s drinking water, as well as negatively affect the streams that locals and tourists use for fishing, boating, and swimming. Due to the damage the dam will inflict on the local area, tourism would decrease, and many of the nearby towns rely on tourist dollars for their revenue, which would hurt their communities.

My family owns a summer cabin that has stood for several generations. If the dam is built, it would directly impact the property.

Please help me and others stop the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal.

This is a comment regarding the proposed Ashokan Pump Station. The proposal from Premier Energy is neglectful of the sensitive nature of the proposed site. Most specifically our reservoir water which will be turbid,  will wreck havoc on our environment- fauna and flora, high power transmission lines will be near homes and can be detrimental to health especially the young and elderly, and will effect tourism. 
Furthermore, Catskill Forest Preserve. 1885 states lands in this status 1 area are to be avoided for development.

I would like to express my concern in regard to the above proposed project since all three possible locations would impact highly preserved land and stream ecology of the Catskill Forest Preserve.

Under the USGS &#34;Gap Analysis Program&#34; the Catskill Forest Preserve is considered Status 1 land. According to DOE&#39;s own Hydropower Vision &#34;areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS program are to be avoided for development&#34;.

Furthermore, the Catskill Forest Preserve is protected by the NYS constitution. Any changes to land management would require a constitutional amendment, to be voted on and passed by two consecutive sessions and then submitted to the public in a referendum.

Thirdly, Premium Energy is proposing this project to FERC as a &#34;closed loop project&#34;, a type of project the DOE supports. The above project is not a closed, but an open loop project since it involves the Ashokan Reservoir as the lower basin. which has the Esopus River running into it and out of it.

I live in Chichester, NY, near one of the proposed sites Premium Energy Holdings is considering for an upper reservoir that would connect to the Ashokan. After reading the proposal, and based on my knowledge of the area, I urge you to deny PEH a preliminary permit to conduct studies on a proposed pumped storage plant. The Catskill Forest Preserve is not the right place for this project, and this for-profit company’s proposal threatens to do more environmental and economic damage than it sets out to solve.
 
All three of the sites under consideration in Premium Energy’s proposal are within the Catskill State Park, which is protected from development by the NYS Constitution unless amended otherwise. These three sites also fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Areas. Further, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the United States Geological Survey’s “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
 
Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which threaten both aquatic and land habitats. Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills most vital trout waters and part of New York City&#39;s water supply. Disrupting the local ecology and subjecting our local waters to cooling and evaporation are not the kinds of trade-offs we can afford. Nor is the potential to seriously harm New York City’s water supply.
 
Please deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit so that local experts can work toward genuine solutions to our energy needs.

     As a resident of Shandaken and the owner of a business in Phoenicia I am writing to voice my strong opposition to granting a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. I acknowledge and support the pursuit of renewable energy projects, but the Catskills is uniquely ill suited for the Premium Energy hydropower endeavor.
     Why is it &#34;uniquely&#34; ill suited?
     Premium Energy is proposing a project in the Catskills Forest Preserve - land under Article XIV of the NYS constitution that &#34;shall be forever kept wild forest...shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; Altering the land management for this project to move forward in the State Forest Preserve would require a state constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature then submission to the public in a referendum. Such amendments rarely pass.
     The Department of Energy&#39;s &#34;Hydropower Vision&#34; recommends that land with formal protection designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program be avoided for development. As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills do fall into the Status 1 land designation.
     The Esopus Creek, one of the East Coast&#39;s most vital trout waters, will be adversely affected by the increased turbidity of the project causing irreparable damage to trout breeding grounds. The pristine Esopus Creek network is fragile and will never recover from such a massive disturbance to its delicate ecology.
     And let&#39;s use common sense. Let&#39;s use our nation&#39;s economic resources sensibly to make good choices in developing renewable energy resources. Think of the millions of dollars that will need to be spent by the parties involved for this project to move forward:
     - the associated costs of amending the state constitution.
     - the review process expenses incurred by the New York State agencies 
       in assessing the project&#39;s negative environmental impact.
     - the litigation expenses New York City will incur in reviewing and 
       fighting this proposal since it will so grossly endanger its water 
       quality.
     Wouldn&#39;t all this money be better used for a project that is better suited to succeed and have solid prospects for coming to fruition? This is not an issue of &#34;we don&#39;t want this project here.&#34; It&#39;s an issue of recognizing the disqualifying circumstances situating this project specifically in the Catskills  that make it prohibitive.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion><div class=card><div class=card-header id=headerPDF10><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapsePDF10 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapsePDF10>

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward. docket number P-15056-000</pre><hr><b>Comments of Zachary Chapman under P-15056.

This proposal lacks in grounding or merit to it&#39;s proposed location. I&#39;m not sure if Premium Energy Holdings, LLC is simply throwing darts at a map right now, as that&#39;s the only possible way anybody could think a project like this would belong in this location:

1. On a general note power production is not a concern for the area to be met. We have issues as any rural area does with outages, but those are all from storms that disrupt the infrastructure, never from demand outpacing supply.
2. In order to build any of the proposals it would not simply mean imminent domain problems for residents and land owners but also getting land from the State of New York who holds land in all of the proposed areas, so they would be taking public land at the expense of every single resident in the state.
3. The Esopus Creek has just been given designation as a river of Wild-Quality by New York Department of Conservation.

This is pretty clearly a plow to fund a feasibility study for somebody to profit, but to never intend on pursing, because anybody in the area can tell you it&#39;s not feasible.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jenni Cawein under P-15056.

The proposed project is out of scale to the area and not energy efficient. Moreover, each of the alternatives would potentially encroach on sensitive ecosystems, including Catskill Park/New York State forever wild lands.  We are all for renewable and sustainable energy.  But this project does not fit well here.

Our region is packed full of headwater streams and waterfalls that would lend themselves well to small hydro projects.  Why in the world would you want to pump water upstream to create a massive closed loop system?  This would be highly inefficient and totally unnecessary.  There are so many opportunities to work with the natural hydraulic corridors here. So why would anyone want to work against them?  Makes little sense – is it just to have a massive project that is not wanted by the locals here?  Exploring smaller scale projects would be so much smarter, and not infringe nearly as much on the beautiful ecosystem we have here.  Larger pumped power storage systems can be useful, but not here.

The future will be in energy efficiency, but this is not efficient.  Not only is there an obviously huge waste of energy in this proposed concept, but energy is also wasted as soon as it enters the grid.  It has been suggested that the pumping energy might be supplied by solar panels during the day. Where would you put those?  Raze our forever wild forest lands?  Or maybe you could construct them miles away and transmit the energy through transmission lines, wasting even more energy.

There are much better solutions to solving our energy challenges, so please don’t go down this short-sighted road.  We need to think further out into the future.  And while a massive concrete uphill holding reservoir is not a good long-term answer, it does have the potential to create long term and possibly permanent damage here.

RE:
FERC project and subdocket number: P-15056:000
Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project
The proposal before you, &#34;Premium Energy Holdings’ First Amendment for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 15056-000,&#34; Document Accession #: 20210201-5022 Filed Date: 02/01/2021, suffers fatal deficiencies. Granting the urgent need for more renewable energy in New York State and nationally, this application for a preliminary permit should be rejected at the outset because the proposed sites are not the right places for this project.
The proposal states falsely on p. 5 that &#34;The location of the proposed project is: State or territory: New York, Counties: Ulster County&#34; and again falsely on p. 7 that &#34;Every county in which any part of the project, and any Federal facilities that would be used by the project, would be located. Ulster County.&#34; In fact, Exhibit 3, page 21, shows clearly that the proposed Stony Clove Reservoir and Dam along Route 214 are approximately 1 mile into Green County in the hamlet of Lanesville.
The proposal states falsely in Exhibit 1 on p. 11: &#34;The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would operate in a closed loop. Aside from evaporation and percolation losses, the project’s water would stay within the system.&#34; The Ashokan Reservoir, the proposed lower reservoir, is part of a flowing water system, fed from above by the Schoharie Reservoir, Esopus Creek, and smaller tributaries, and flowing downstream into Esopus Creek and the water-supply system of New York City (NYC). The Schoharie and Ashokan Reservoirs provide approximately 40% of the daily water supply of NYC&#39;s 9 million inhabitants. The water that would flush at high pressure (594-914 feet of head claimed in the proposal) and high velocity from any of the proposed upper reservoirs into the depth of the Ashokan Reservoir upper (western) basin would stir up a century&#39;s worth of sediment, add its own sediment, and commingle with the outflow to both NYC and Esopus Creek downstream. This is NOT a closed-loop system. It is an add-on project for open-loop pumped-storage hydropower because the proposed project’s lower reservoir, Ashokan Reservoir, is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed to construct the Ashokan Reservoir.
The proposal states on p. 13 that approximately 15,800 acre-ft of water would be used for pumping or generating 800 MW over 12 hours of continuous output. The proposal also states on p. 13 that the Ashokan Reservoir has &#34;around 382,358 acre-ft of storage capacity. Also, additional water volume at Ashokan reservoir would be discharged through the Esopus Creek (southeast basin).&#34; That last sentence contradicts the proposal&#39;s earlier claim on p. 11 that this is a closed-loop system. But more importantly, the Ashokan Reservoir is divided by a spillway into a western basin upstream and an eastern basin downstream. Water is released from upstream to downstream. Therefore the western basin would take the full impact of the proposed 15,800 acre-ft of water. According to Adam Bosch at the NYC Department of Environmental Proection, the western basin has a surface area of 3,106 acres and a storage volume of 143,700 acre-ft when full.  So the daily rise and fall of the western basin would be 5.09 ft = 15800 ÷ 3106 and the 15,800 acre-ft pumped in each 12-hour power cycle would be 11% = 15,800 ÷ 143,700 of the western basin volume.  Every 9 days the entire volume of the western basin could turn over, assuming the western basin were full throughout. Most of the time, the western basin is far from full, so total turnover of the western basin would happen faster and the surface level fluctuation would be more extreme than 5 feet. Such mixing could not fail to perturb in disastrous ways the ecology within the Ashokan Reservoir, the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems overlap (as a result of the 5-foot surface water elevation fluctuation), and the quality of the water supplied to NYC.
The three sites proposed for the upper reservoir would cause major damage to highly preserved land in the Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County. Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 2 land under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.&#34; The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area. The proposed project would destroy these irreplaceable natural areas, undermine the attractiveness of the area for tourism, weaken the local economy, pollute downstream, and possibly wreck one of NYC&#39;s major capital assets, its water supply system.
In conclusion, granting the urgent need for more renewable energy in New York State and nationally, this preliminary permit application should be rejected at the outset, because the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding forests and mountains are not the right place for this project.

I do understand and appreciate the need to create more truly renewable energy sources. We cannot allow typical NIMBY concerns to block all projects. 

 

However, this proposal is truly deficient, would cause massive and irreparable harm to protected lands and to people, and should be denied on its merits. The proposed sites in the Catskills region are on Status 1 land, and the Department of Energy has clearly stated that Status 1 or 2 land must be avoided for any development. The proposed project will cause severe ecological damage, particularly on streams resulting in increased turbidity and sediment in water that serve as an unfiltered drinking water source and blocking the natural spawning areas of trout and other wildlife.

 

Furthermore, the proposed project is not a true ‘closed loop” energy source and is not the type of innovation that is being sought; it could even result in a net loss of energy given its reliance on traditional pumping to higher elevations. 

 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I respectfully ask that you prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Leo J Warren under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/25/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Leo J Warren, Shokan, NY.
The Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal is not beneficial for this area or community. I am a town of Olive resident I grew up in Shandaken.  I am a property owner as well as a business owner in this area. This proposal is not displaying any benefit to this community. Only negative effects for the people and profits for a company that isn&#39;t based in New York.  It is a California based company coming into upstate New York to make money and destroy our community and lands. Coming into the area and acting like it is ok to relocate families in a time where people cannot find homes to live. This demonstrates the lack of care for our community. Hiding under the umbrella of renewable energy is unacceptable and creating a false vision of what it will do for our community. I am against this proposal. During the town board presentation a question was asked what&#39;s in it for the community the company representative replied it is renewable energy. They are not looking out for us the residents of this community they are looking out for their bottom line. One of the reasons we all live here is because of the community and lands. Allowing an organization to destroy our lands and potentially remove families from our community is unacceptable.</pre><hr><b>Comment of Mary M Schroeder in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 3/25/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mary M Schroeder, Lanesville, NY.

The community here, our land and house would be destroyed.  Our neighbors would all lose their houses and our way of life here would come to an end.

Its hard to ignore the devastating impacts on the natural environment that this pumped-storage power plant will have. For one thing, as this PowerPoint is more than happy to inform us, the building of an upper-level reservoir will &#34;wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats&#34; but also &#34;[destroy] valuable trout breeding habitat&#34; (slide 26, Strand). As a matter of fact, the only benefits to building this plant that are ever outlined have little to no impact on the local residents surrounding the reservoir. The only benefits to this project are economical, and they only economically benefit New York City and the companies who are building it. 

I implore concerned individuals, activists, and anybody living around here to read that PowerPoint and ask yourself &#34;what will this do for me?&#34; The answer is, quite simply, nothing. 

My concern with this project is that the negative environmental and economic impacts of it will be bared only by the local people, and that this is yet another frightening example of a government overstepping their boundaries to make up for a lack of adequately and sustainably designed city infrastructure. The PowerPoint provided on the Town of Olive website does nothing to dissuade me from that.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Abby Heijnen under P-15056.

To whom it may concern,

This letter is to register my vigorous opposition to the above proposed Permit and project!
This proposal includes an inappropriate siting of  a large dammed reservoir in a NYS forest, an underground hydro plant in West Shokan and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the town of Ulster. ALL IN THE CATSKILL STATE PARK and surrounding area. 

The idea of this project in a pristine natural environment, where tourism is a major source of income for our communities, is absolutely unacceptable!

This California company is arbitrarily choosing sites all over the country for investment, without regard to the impact on our community.

The town of Olive has already suffered a loss of income from the building of the Ashokan reservoir and we, as residents, are required to comply with strict and extra costly regulations in order to keep New York City&#39;s water supply fresh and clean.

Though I am a supporter of clean energy, there must be consideration for appropriate locations.

Please deny them this permit and keep them, and anyone else, from building projects that would desecrate our natural environment.

I live in West Shokan, NY. I’m curious to know what started the interest in the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. I would like to see the Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) reports. There are several bald eagle nesting sites located along the Ashokan reservoir and in the areas for the 3 proposed reservoirs, what will be done to protect them and other wildlife? Why are  the transmission lines running on the southern side of the Ashokan Reservoir, instead of along NYS Route 28 on the northern side? Why do the proposed facilities need to be located 200-300 feet below ground level? Will the building of this effect the well water systems of local residents? How much noise, traffic disruption, dust, etc. can we expect from the construction of this? Since this will be underground, how much blasting will there be? Or will mining equipment be used used and if so, what type will be brought in? Will local labor be used or is this a private out-of-state company’s labor force? Once it’s built, who owns it and maintains it?</pre><hr><b>Comments of Benjamin Obler under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/23/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Benjamin Obler, Olivebridge, NY.

To Whom It May Concern:

As a resident of Olive, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I VIGOROUSLY OBJECT to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. 

Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

Thank you.

To whom it may concern :

I am writing to you as a concerned Woodland Valley resident, who is against the proposed  underground hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir by the company Premium Energy Holdings LLC.

The  proposed locations for the new reservoirs would mean taking away private property from people and in one case – for the prospective WoodlandReservoir – involve flooding an entire community, Woodland Valley, which is the community that I live in. Additionally, this proposed plant poses potential issues with town infrastructure, individual wells, regional infrastructure as related to the electric grid, and environmental sensitivities.

We do not want this plant coming to our beautiful and protected environment here in the Catskill Mountain Region!

The plant would utilize electricity to pump water to the upper reservoir.  This is inefficient and hardly innovation.  The public deserves a higher standard for an energy project.

The area is used for recreation.   The disruption of construction and the lasting impact on the natural resources in the area would have unforeseen economic impact.

Construction, ongoing operation, and potential accidents would have devastating impact on the aquatic environment in the immediate and surrounding areas.  This is totally unacceptable considering the history of the aquatic environment and its economic potential. 

The proposed area is on Status 1 land and would require legislative effort at the state level to move forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Danielle M Bliss under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/24/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Danielle M Bliss, Shokan, NY.

This will bring a lot of damage to protected forests and wildlife. This area is home to many eagles and birds of prey. I did not buy a home in Shokan to be near a destructive power plant.

To whom it concerns:

I am writing about Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric plant in the Catskills. I live next to the Catskills and know the area well, as I hike in there every week. I know all three proposed locations. I am shocked at the choices, as they are all manifestly unsuitable for a project of this kind. 

Premium Energy’s proposal seems haphazard and sloppy and quickly put together without any real knowledge of the area, of the obvious impacts this project will have on this major tourism area, or of the laws that apply to these projects and the Catskill Park.

1. The Catskill Park is constitutionally protected as “forever wild&#34; and is highy preserved Status 1 Land. The Department of Energy has said that Status 1 or 2 must be avoided for development. Premium Energy seem unaware that their project will require an amendment to the State Constitution which protects the Catskill Park. 

2. This region is where fly fishing began in the United States and this project threatens to destroy that valuable legacy with sediment build-up which will decimate local trout habitat.

3. This project not kind of innovation DoE is looking for. This is not a true “closed loop” project. Premium Energy’s proposal is deficient. It does not deserve the streamlined application process.

Thank you for your consideration of these points.

Motion to Intervene of Dawn Peters for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, 
Project No. P-15056

As a resident in an impacted community and as a taxpayer in that community, Chichester in Ulster County, the State of New York, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will undoubtedly impact environmental resources and state constitutionally protected public land that I have a stakeholder interest in as a contributing taxpayer. 

The proposed Stoney Clove dam, located in Lanesville, would be approximately 1.25 miles north of my home and Stoney Clove Creek streamside property. This CEMENT BARRIER would be 2,600 feet in length and 212 feet high. EFFECTIVELY CHOKING the Stoney Clove Creek and altering the streambank and aquatic habitat of any plant or animal living in this cold water stream.

In light of the uncertainties of global warming, NO FEASIBILITY STUDY NOR COMPUTER MODELLING can predict the added consequences of a construction site and eventual dam, tunnels, high tension wires, turbines, etc., on the delicate balance of nature we have here in the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Forests act as a filter. This natural filter keeps NYC&#39;s unfiltered drinking water system clean by preventing the runoff of chemicals and soil into waterways and eventually the upper Ashokan Reservoir, which already holds years of silt, sediment, etc. Locally, the dam would undoubtedly impact the area&#39;s water table, wells, MY WELL, stream turbidity, and ultimately, it would have to affect NYC&#39;s drinking water quality. Stoney Clove Creek, a source of life and sustenance, would inevitably be forever changed. 

I, Dawn Peters, respectfully request that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings. 

Respectfully submitted,
Dawn Peters

We understand the fact that the government has requirements to take appropriate action(s) for our future electric needs, and we understand the government’s thoughts that green energy style so-called renewable energy sources are considered the future.

The following are our concerns with this project’s three proposed locations:
•	Lanesville – This site is the farthest equating to the causing the most environmental damage running the pipeline through Phoenicia, Chichester, and Stoney Clove. It also involves the longest run of pipeline, which will make it the most expensive to operate insofar as the energy required to pump water from the Ashokan Reservoir to the Upper Reservoir, negating any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	Woodland Valley - Though Woodland Valley is much closer, by half the distance of Lanesville, it posses a very similar environmental damage issue, plus seems to eliminate access to the State campground and hiking trails which are a major attraction and revenue generator for the area.
•	Both the Lanesville and the Woodland Valley sites would require the pipeline extend through the Route 28 Corridor causing more environmental damage, raise the costs of pumping the water, and will further negate any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	MoonHaw Road – This site seems the best possible choice. It would involve the least amount of environmental damage and the least amount of pipeline, which would decrease the costs of pumping water, though I haven’t seen any data on at what length pumping becomes financially worthwhile.
•	All three locations would require further environmental damage for the power lines and connections to the grid the project requires.

We are also concerned about the overall environmental impact of this project and how it will affect the Ashokan Reservoir’s ecosystem as well as the ecosystems of the Esopus and other creeks, all of which need extensive study before a decision like this should be considered. Plus, the government needs to study the possible impact this could have on the downstate needs of NYC residents as it will have an impact on their drinking water supply. Furthermore, the entire Catskill Park Forest Preserve, of which this project falls within, could be drastically affected and will require extensive study to determine the impacts.

As stated in the bullets above, pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir to another reservoir, by design, can only consume more energy than it creates, and we question where the energy to perform all that pumping is coming from as it sounds like it will require more fossil fuel utilization, not less.

As a last point, we understand that the concern over whether green energy investments reduce the costs of electricity to its citizens aren’t always a determining factor in government decisions, but this project goes beyond that consideration as, previously stated, it would all take place within the Blue Line of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve and be devastating to the ecosystem. As such, this project seems more appropriate for State land along the Hudson river where connecting to grid infrastructure would be much easier, cause less damage to the environment, and be part of a hydro ecosystem that is much more robust than the Esopus feed to the Ashokan reservoir will ever be.

In closing, we thank you for your consideration of our concerns and comments.

Hello. I am a resident of Jewett NY (northern Catskills) and Brooklyn NY. I am writing to voice my opposition to this proposal. I initially started researching this project because I&#39;m interested in pumped storage as a critical component of our clean energy future, and I would normally vocally support such a project to combat the NIMBY attitude. But I cannot support this project for a number of reasons. 
Primarily, this project would attempt to take state land within the Blue Line of the Catskills State Park which has been designated as forever wild. (I don&#39;t understand the legal mechanisms by which they could take this land without a state-wide referendum in addition to a vote by two consecutive sessions of our state legislature.) 
Secondly, this project would undoubtedly increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir. Turbidity is already a big issue for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the city&#39;s water department.
This is the right project but in the WRONG location.
I truly support pumped-storage projects. (I work in environmental sustainability and climate resilience so I understand the issues.) But this is not the right location. Other projects that  (1) do not rely on protected state lands and (2) do not threaten the NYC drinking water system should be considered. If such a project comes forward, I will gladly support it in opposition to the NIMBY movement.

To whom it may concern,
As a local resident who walks, hikes, and enjoys fishing in the upper and lower Esopus creek as well as in the Ashokan reservoir, it seems hard to believe FERC would even propose such a disastrous project and flood even more homes and properties in the Catskills. It is very clear that this proposed project would displace residents, destroy natural habitat, and create an unwelcome ecological disaster within the Catskill watershed. The “power plant” as designed would warm the waters of the Ashokan Reservoir to the extent that the trout population would dwindle, and the habitat would be severely harmed.
I vigorously oppose this proposed project and request that the Federal Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. This proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed will likely render our beautiful area with irreparable damage and cause turbidity in waters that serve as unfiltered water to millions of people in New York City.

I am also greatly concerned about the dams having an effect on the resevoir and resevoir ecosystem. So you want to build a hydro electric station with the same reservoir you supply all of NYC&#39;s water? That sounds kinda dangerous if anything were to go wrong in any stages of the project as well as during operation. The Ashokan reservoir is a beautiful place and the surrounding areas are amazing yet your proposing to destroy some of it for more power? Most the residents out here want solar so this would benefit whom? I for one am against any kind of development within the area, ESPECIALLY within my own immediate area.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am a resident of Chichester, NY (Ulster County), and I am writing against the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings – their proposal is both misleading and deficient.

I am a citizen who cares deeply about reducing our country’s reliance on fossil fuels. I believe we ought to transition to renewable energy, and there are many good things to be said for hydropower. However, the Catskills area is not the right place for this kind of project. The damage that would be done to state preserved forest land, waterways, and wildlife is immeasurable.

Importantly, Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal is misleading and deficient: While the company says it won’t touch the Catskills Forest Preserve, its actual plan locates the project right in the heart of the Catskills Preserve, which is 700,000 acres of land protected by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution. The Article states these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” If the company wants to change the land management of the State Forest Preserve, a constitutional amendment is required, one that is voted on twice by the NY state legislature and submitted to the public in a referendum. 

In a hydropower project, the fluctuations of pumped water would increase the turbidity of the New York City water supply (the Catskills water supply provides 40% of New York City’s drinking water). Perhaps more importantly, it would wreak havoc on land and aquatic habitats. All of the natural streams that would be affected are vital trout waters, and important trout spawning grounds would be destroyed.

The Catskills Forest Preserve is 700,000 contiguous acres of wildlife habitat. Premium Energy’s proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area and on land that is home to many protected species: 

•	“threatened species” such as the northern long-eared bat; 
•	“species of greatest conservation need” such as the black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush; 
•	“species of special concern” such as Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, Eastern hognose snake, and timber rattlesnake. 

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal is also misleading in that it is described as a closed-loop system when it is clearly presented as an open-loop design.  Both the Stony Clove and Woodland Valley upper reservoir designs involve and affect the free-flowing Stony Clove and Woodland Valley Creeks.  I live on the Stony Clove and know that, since 1995, the Stony Clove has received funding from the NYC DEP Stream Management Program, the US Army Corps of Engineers under the Watershed Environmental Assistance Program, and NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (http://www.catskillstreams.org/stonyclovesmp.html).  This significant investment in time, money, and resources has greatly improved turbidity / water quality and and the health of the Creek’s ecology.

The damage that this proposed project would inflict on the ecology of state protected land is immense and unimaginable. I urge you to protect our natural resources and deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit.

Sincerely,

Ben DeRosa

 Please require Premium Energy to, at the very least, resubmit their application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, their proposal is not a closed loop system, as represented, and as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re also aware, there are numerous other factual errors in their application. It goes without saying that such an enormous project should have meticulous planning and attention to detail prior to submission.
 This project, if ultimatly allowed to go forward (at any level) would have a negative impact of such magnitude effecting countless entities, that the result will be immediate and continuous pushback and never ending litigation. In my opinion, it will become increasingly obvious that Premium Energy didn&#39;t spend the time  and effort necessarty for proper proposal of such a plan and its location.
This is simply not the place for this project. I believe this will become increasingly obvious, to the extent this plan is allowed to go forward. I am also  of the belief, based on my experience of 45 years as a trial attorney and from what I&#39;ve seen thus far here (both from Premium Energy&#39;s initial application and the resulting reaction to same in the short time it&#39;s been public) that ultimately this project will not go forward in this location. How much time and money end up wasted remains to be seen.

I have concerns about the impacts of the proposed dams that are part of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  I see no information concerning the impacts of a dam on the fish in the stream that will be dammed nor any indications that the dam will be designed to not impact local fisheries.  Also, I have seen indications that the increased inflow to the Ashokan Reservoir will cause increased turbidity.  The turbidity of the water in the reservoir is already a cause for concern as it impacts the lower Esopus Creek. 
 
Our area is known for outdoor activities, especially trout fishing.  Any damage to the environment, especially to the streams, will have impacts on the ecology and the economy of the region.  Once any damage is caused by construction such as with dams, it is difficult to recover from.  The impacts need to be fully assessed and discussed before any permitting is allowed.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jennifer Vallance in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I value the environment and hope to seek out renewable energy sources but do not think this is in the best interest of the Town.  I raised a few concerns with FERC re: the impact on the quality of the water and the surrounding land.  Each member, all from different departments, indicated that “can be a concern”.  If they feel that way, then it is of deep concern to me as I’m sure it must be to the millions of people who live in NYC (as this is the main source of their water supply).

In addition, the proposal of additional, yet smaller, reservoirs bothers me for the simple fact that we already have several flood zones in the area and have gone to great time and expense to avoid the potential for flooding.  Over time and with the potential for erosion mentioned in several of FERC’s studies, I can only see this as a problematic area that will need to be addressed down the line.

Additionally, the State has gone to great expense to provide the Rail Trail which draws great crowds during all four seasons of the year.  Offering hiking, biking, etc. and the observation of many species of birds and other animals (some nearing extinction or on the wildlife protection list).  A project such as this will surely be a disruption to them in their natural habitat.

I think most people agree we all want to preserve the planet we share but it is hard to justify doing it this way when the health of many may suffer, the natural habitat may disappear and all that is beautiful about this area will be torn apart in the process.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Everest Schmidt in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I write as a resident of Olive that I am concerned about the proposed placement of the hydro electric dam and power plant. From my understanding, this project will have a significant negative environmental and ecological effect on lands, at least partially, protected by New York’s Constitution. See Article XIV, Section 1, of the New York Constitution (“The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.”) How many trees will be decimated in these beautiful Catskills mountains to string high voltage power lines and the bulldozing for a reservoir.

What remains of the wild must be protected. The natural beauty of these mountains draws  thousands of visitors from all over the world to these small communities, thus helping sustain our small businesses. Any kind of massive construction project, such as the proposed plan, should be looked at with strict scrutiny. 

This application should be denied.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marisa Ann Perez Rogers under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/23/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marisa Ann Perez Rogers, Shokan, NY.

The following is written by a 10-year-old adversary to the pumped hydro project proposal.

The scent of trees drifts through the air. The Esopus Stream is making its way through the rocks. In my opinion the dam should not be built that will drown Woodland Valley and flood this stream. The dam should not be built because it is home to many plants and animals, people live there, the water won’t be the prettiest, there is a lot of history, and it uses more energy than it creates.         

First off, Woodland Valley is home to many plants and animals. Their homes would be destroyed and they would most likely die. Most of Woodland Valley&#39;s natural beauties are because of them. This makes Woodland Valley the perfect destination for wildlife lovers. As you can see Woodland Valley is home to many plants and animals.

My second reason is that people live there. They would have to move out of their houses not because they wanted to. There is even a whole colony that has made many traditions specific to that piece of land. Also would you like to have someone tell you you have to move out of your house and go somewhere else? To sum it up people live there and you would be wrecking their homes and properties.

Third, the water isn’t the prettiest. It isn’t the blue waters of Hawaii. The mountains are the Valley’s prettiest aspect. Sure water is fun but why bring more of it to a perfectly fine creek. To conclude the water isn’t the prettiest. 

Lastly, it is going to use more energy than it creates. First, it is just a silly idea if you have to drown places just to take energy and produce less than you took. Secondly, energy is not a toy, you are supposed to treasure it and not use it irresponsibly. Also, there are other environmental friendly options to produce energy that don’t involve a dam and water. In conclusion this way of making electricity is a bad idea because it is going to use more energy than it is going to create.

As you can see the dam should not be built. Not only is Woodland Valley home to many examples of wildlife, but there are many people who call it home, the water won’t be the prettiest, there is a lot of history, and it is going to use more energy than it creates. So call the building of the dam off and save the valley.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Julia Muro under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/23/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Julia Muro, Durham, CT.

Pumped Storage Electrical Generating Systems consume MORE electricity than they produce.  It takes more energy to pump water to the upper reservoir than is produced when the water flows back downhill.  The advantage to pumped storage is that the electricity costs less to move the water uphill because that happens typically at night when electricity demand is low.  The electricity produced when the water flows down is more valuable because that happens when electrical demand is high. Pumped storage can be a net producer of electricity only if a stream or river adds water to the upper reservoir.

The advantage to pumped storage besides the economics for the electric company is that it is more reliable since wind or sunlight are not factors like in &#34;green&#34; generating systems.

To build a pumped storage system would require dams, reservoirs and tunnels.  The disruption and habitat loss, as well as monetary cost, is not justified.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marisa Beauchemin under P-15056.

I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Hydroelectric pumped storage facility that Premium Energy Holdings has proposed in the Catskill region of New York (P-15056-000). 

I volunteer with the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference to maintain one of the trails accessed from the Woodland Valley Campground within the Catskill Forest Preserve, in an area that would be flooded by the proposed upper reservoir of this project. Our public campgrounds, trails, and streams are some of the most popular in the Catskill Forest Preserve, and attract people from all walks of life, including anglers, endurance athletes, thru-hikers on the Long Path, young families, and people simply looking for a change of scenery from urban life. New York State parks, trails, campgrounds, and historic sites saw a record 78 million visits in 2020, surpassing the previous record set in 2019 [1]. Our public lands were ever more important during a year of grief and isolation, and public campgrounds are a vital resource in the movement to make outdoor recreation more welcoming to people of color and other marginalized groups. Flooding Woodland Valley to create an upper reservoir for open-loop pumped hydropower energy storage would destroy this beloved resource.

In all three of the proposed locations, creating an upper reservoir by flooding the valley would destroy homes and communities, remove access to our public lands, and destroy the livelihoods of people who work adjacent to tourism in the region. The alternative site for the reservoir in Lanesville would destroy the recreational resources of the Devil’s Tombstone Campground and the fly fishing along Stony Clove. The proposed site in West Shokan would also destroy a residential center and a popular trailhead at the end of Moonhaw Road. 

All three of the proposed locations would encroach on the boundaries of the Catskill Forest Preserve, land that is designated by the New York State Constitution as “forever wild.” Encroaching on the forest preserve is difficult, as it should be: it requires a state constitutional amendment, two consecutive votes in state legislature, and a referendum. I urge you to reject this project swiftly, and not waste the time of your own agency and that of our state agencies tasked with protecting our public lands.

I am a NYC resident and I am very concerned this project would affect the drinking water for me and 9 million neighbors.  Our water supply is not an experiment.

Dear Governor Cuomo:

There is a proposal, which is part of the Premium Energy Proposal,  to build a new, 225-acre reservoir and dam running 1/2 mile long in West Shokan.    Much of the construction would be underground, but it’s unclear to me whether there would be blasting and depredation of the visual environment were the dam to be approved. The environment here is the chief reason my late wife and I moved here 24 years ago. 
 
I received a flyer from a local group with whom I usually have few dealings, so the actual impact of the project is unclear to me. I note that property values here have soared in recent months, and the question needs to be asked whether the destructive effects on real estate values and the environment (the project abuts hiking trails and state campgrounds) will equal the economic gain from additional electricity.  Houses here that were worth $150,000 two years ago are now worth $400,000. The demand for outdoor recreation has also soared.
 
The city has a history, which goes back 120 years, of pursuing projects of benefit to the city without concern for costs to the Town of Olive.   I doubt that the costs have been accurately assessed, nor is it clear what the environmental damage will be, nor is it clear that the funds will be available to complete a long-term project.
 
Sincerely

I have lived in the Ashokan Reservoir area for over 40 years. While I have seen many changes, there is one feature that endures.  The Ashokan Reservoir remains a spectacular natural habitat for many species - while some are endangered all of them matter.  Most important, the habitat endures as a natural haven only a hundred miles from one of the world’s great metropolitan areas; and is a symbol to our commitment to the environment. This habitat then goes on to effortlessly provide clean, quality, pure water to that city of 9 plus million.  While Pumped Storage facilities offer promise and while it is an emerging technology, the Ashokan Reservoir is the wrong site for this.This will be a massive project and will disrupt and destroy this very valuable habitat, regardless of the assurances anyone can provide.  I voice my opposition to this project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Hunter West under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/20/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hunter West, Huntingdon Valley, PA.
The Proposed Hydroelectric Plant at the Ashokan Reservoir is a poorly thought out attempt at producing sustainable energy. Premium Energy have not provided
enough information on this project to warrant hand waving of any part of their
proposal. To create an inefficient hydroelectric plant that must pump water uphill to yield energy in the first place is a poor plan. On top of this, building on status 1 land is just inviting a legal battle that could end up delaying this project for a long time. If the state of New York wants to get sustainable energy to its citizens right away, then why try to take land that will require an amendment to the New York State constitution, which protects the Catskills. With Joe Biden now president, there is a solid chance that nuclear power plants in the state of New York will have the funding to reopen sometime in the next four years. In addition to this, wind and solar can easily be substituted with a much smaller environmental impacts on one of New York&#39;s greatest treasures. The untouched Catskills region is the primary reason that I, as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, visit and spend money in the state of New York. Please take time to solicit more reasonable and thought out sustainable energy proposals before rushing into any attempts to fundamentally alter the Catskills region.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read my comment,

This proposal is almost laughable.  All of the proposed sites are status 1 land which should be avoided per DOE.  Further, any development in this area would require an amendment to the NYS Constitution.  The region in question has already suffered due to the extensive network of NYC drinking water reservoirs.  Further, this are is used extensively for recreational pursuits, including hiking, camping, fishing and hunting.  In a state as densely populated as NY, eliminating land suitable for such activities should always be a last resort.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Phoebe Jones under P-15056.

Washington, D.C. 20426

Dear Kimberly D. Bose,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ plan to build a hydroelectric plant in the Ashokan Reservoir region of Ulster County.

As my husband, in-laws, and several members of our extended family have indicated in their own comments, our family has owned a house in Woodland Valley for more than 75 years. The house and the valley it sits in are a family heirloom. While we own the house, the valley and its natural and beauty are accessible to all and are widely utilized. The state campground at the end of Woodland Valley Road, which would become inaccessible if Premium Energy Holdings’ plan comes to fruition, is an affordable way for the public to enjoy the idyllic mountain air, water, hiking, and fishing in Woodland Valley. It attracts thousands of visitors annually who bring with them a significant positive economic impact on the surrounding communities and the businesses that call those communities home. Without those visitors and the others who rent houses in the valley, these businesses and the economy of Phoenicia and the surrounding communities would suffer tremendously. They depend on tourism for their survival, and the tourism is dependent on the area’s natural beauty. 

Even conducting a study on the feasibility of such a short-sighted project would cause serious harm to the environment and natural beauty of the region. Building the temporary roads mentioned in Premium Energy Holdings’ filing will create air, noise, and water pollution and damage the environment.

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to use eminent domain to seize privately owned land is inappropriate. They are a private, for-profit entity asking the state to use a provision intended for the public good of all citizens in order to increase their own private profit. Moreover, nearly 75% of the power generated by the proposed plant will go toward running the plant, leaving very little to supplement the existing power grid.

Even if there is a gain in terms of cheaper or additional energy, which seems far-fetched based on the proposal, that gain would be vastly outweighed by the economic cost of acquiring the privately-owned land, the negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, the negative environmental impact of destroying the natural flow of the Woodland Valley Creek, and the destruction and loss of one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in all of the United States: Woodland Valley, New York.

For these reasons, I urge the FERC to stop the wasteful, unnecessary destruction of Woodland Valley before it begins. Deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal before it ruins the quality of life, livelihoods, and well-being of the people of the region and the land itself.

Sincerely,

Phoebe Jones</pre><hr><b>Comments of Drew Boggess under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/20/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Drew Boggess, Shokan, NY.
Comments concerning FERC Project No. P-15056-000

I am asking FERC to deny the application for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan pumped storage project submitted by Premium Energy Holdings on January 29, 2021.  This project application has many severe technical errors in  it.  I will only address a couple of them in this comment.  It is difficult to determine if the applicant is out-and-out lying, or is incompetent, or simply failed to adequately do proper research for this application.

First, on page 11 of the application, the applicant says the system they are proposing is a closed-loop system.  This is blatantly wrong.  The Ashokan reservoir was built approximately 115 years ago and provides drinking water to New York City.  The Esopus creek flows into the western basin of the reservoir along with several small to meadium streams.  The Esopus creek then flows out of the eastern basin of the reservoir.  Approximately 40% of New York City’s clean drinking water flows through the Ashokan reservoir.  So, the system they are proposing is actually an open-loop system.  And as you know, DoE encourages the use of closed-loop systems for pumped storage, not open-loop systems.

 Second, on page 13, 2. A, the applicant indicates the pumping of 15.800 acre-ft would cause the reservoir surface variation of 2 ft based on a reservoir surface area of 8300 acres.  Again, the applicant didn’t do their homework, because they failed to understand how the Ashokan reservoir works.  The Ashokan reservoir has two distinct basins with a dividing weir between them.  The Western basin (this is the basin the applicant indicates pumping will occur) is designed as a settling basin to reduce turbidly in the water before flowing into the eastern basin and on to New York City.  So, water flows from the western basin to the eastern basin and cannot flow in the opposite direction.  Therefore, when calculating the variation of the surface level you must use the surface area of the western basin which is 3106 acres at full capacity.  When pumping 15,800 acre-ft the surface level variation of the western basin would be 5.09 ft.   Also, the western basin has a volume of 143,700 acre-ft when full, which means every day the pump storage system would be pumping about 11% of the western basin volume at full capacity.   These numbers only get worse when the western basin is not full, which is most of the time.

If the applicant can make these serious technical errors at this level of preliminary concept, how can they possibly be trusted to design a system without major flaws?</pre><hr><b>Comments of William Thompson under P-15056.

As a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County, I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I support our nation’s transition to renewable energy and recognize the many benefits of hydropower, I believe the Catskills region is not the right location for such a project given significant impacts to state preserved forest land, streams, species, and the New York City water supply. Much of the harm would be unlawful and in violation of the New York State Constitution. Additionally, Premium Energy does not provide the kind of innovation sought by the Department of Energy given that its proposal is deficient and misleading. 

Premium Energy’s claim that it will build a “closed loop” system is false; closer study indicates their proposal is actually an “open loop” system, an “add on” project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source. As you know, the environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 

The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve (established 1885). This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Any change in the management of State Forest Preserves have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum. Otherwise, it is unlawful and unconstitutional.

Consider also the fact that, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According the US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy’s proposal; and DoE’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Sincerely,

Doris Cheng</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ben Kilgust under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/21/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Ben Kilgust, Oakland, CA.

The Premium Energy Holding’s proposed Ashokan hydroelectric project does is not well suited for the Catskills and the Ashokan reservoir.  Nine million NYC residents depend upon the reservoir for their drinking water.  It is not something that should be put in jeopardy.  The project would also be disruptive to local ecosystems.  The beauty of the Catskills brings many of us to the area to recreate and contributes to the economy in the region.

Dear FERC,

I have been a full-time resident in Shandaken, NY for the last 21 years, and I am writing to respectfully express my strong opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal to build a pumped storage hydropower plant in our area. I understand the need to move away from fossil fuels to counter global warming and am an ardent proponent of clean, renewable energy. However, the proposed project is totally inappropriate for this area for numerous reasons, a few of which I will mention below.

Premium Energy proposes to build its project in the middle of New York City’s watershed, the Catskill Park and Forest Preserve—priceless public resources. Ninety percent of New York City’s water comes from the Catskill/Delaware ¬¬¬water system, the largest unfiltered water supply in the country, providing 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people. The Ashokan Reservoir, which Premium Energy is proposing to use as its lower reservoir, provides about 40 percent of the city’s daily drinking water. The pumped storage project proposes to build an upper reservoir, in one of three places: along the Stony Clove in Lanesville, along Woodland Valley Stream in Phoenicia, or in Olive by flooding homes on Moonhaw Road. The Ashokan already has problems with silt buildup. Pumping water back and forth from these upper reservoirs would add to the turbidity of the Ashokan, degrading the quality of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage projects are also known to damage stream ecology, with negative impacts on both aquatic and land habitats. Water from an upper reservoir either on the Stony Clove or in Woodland Valley would travel back to the Ashokan Reservoir via the Esopus Creek. The Esopus is a major trout habitat and world class trout fishing stream that attracts fly fishermen from all over the world. Degradation or loss of trout habitat in the Esopus would also cause economic harm to our area.
 
The Catskills Forest Preserve is designated in Article XIV of the New York State Constitution as lands that “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision states that “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Since the Catskills are a State Forest Preserve, the land that makes up the Forest Preserve is classified as Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. Therefore, the entire Catskill Forest Preserve must be removed from consideration of Premier Energy’s proposed pumped storage hydropower project.

Thank you for your consideration.

As a former New Yorker who owned a home about eight miles from the Ashokan Reservoir and hopes to live near there again soon, I am shocked and disappointed at the thoughtlessness of the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. I have hiked and swam in the Woodland Valley, and attended a square dance (SERIOUSLY, a square dance) at a wonderful gathering place for a group of homes that have been owned by families for a hundred years.  Energy creation by flooding areas that are protected, vital, and carefully enjoyed is not a solution.

The proposed pumped storage project is not the best way to provide storage capacity. 

The project is within Catskill State Park.  This is a scenic resource. Residents of the Hudson Valley are very aware of the Storm King pumped storage proposal, which was defeated. Resistance is already gathering.

Other technologies exist to fill this need. Edison battery (nickel-iron) storage was recently put forward as an alternative to an unsuccessful local gas fired peak power plant proposal.  These larger batteries are safer than lithium batteries, so a facility can be the same size as a lithium storage facility which requires spacing of units for fire safety. Several Edison battery storage buildings could be sited around the electrical grid to provide this capacity, even though their energy storage density is not as large as a pumped storage facility. 

Pumped storage reservoirs are not viable living habitats, as they are drained when used, and the contents fed through turbines.  The remaining biomass would be deposited into a drinking water reservoir to decay.   The Ashokan reservoir already has faced water quality problems, which require watershed management regulations, and is now facing sediment management trouble in the lower Esopus.

Motion to Intervene of David Traub for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, Project No. 15056-000

All communications, pleadings, and orders with respect to this proceeding should be sent to the following individual:

David Traub
165 East 32nd Street
Apt 12G
New York, NY 10016

I, David Traub, own property, including land and physical residence, within one of the proposed building sites included in the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Project No. 15056-000. As such, I am seeking a Motion to Intervene. 

The proposed building site, Alternative 3, Wittenberg Reservoir, is located where my residence and my entire property exists. I would no longer be able to use any part of my property or residence if this project were approved at the proposed building site, Alternative 3, Wittenberg Reservoir. The address of my property located within the proposed building site is:

325 Moonhaw Rd.
West Shokan, NY 10016

I have important information and perspectives to bring to this process, consideration of which will serve the public interest.

Wherefore, I, David Traub, respectfully requests that the Commission to grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings.

Respectfully submitted,

David Traub

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 

I do understand and appreciate the need to create more truly renewable energy sources. We cannot allow typical NIMBY concerns to block all projects. 

However, this proposal is truly deficient, would cause massive and irreparable harm to protected lands and to people, and should be denied on its merits. The proposed sites in the Catskills region are on Status 1 land, and the Department of Energy has clearly stated that Status 1 or 2 land must be avoided for any development. The proposed project will cause severe ecological damage, particularly on streams resulting in increased turbidity and sediment in water that serve as an unfiltered drinking water source and blocking the natural spawning areas of trout and other wildlife.

Furthermore, the proposed project is not a true ‘closed loop” energy source and is not the type of innovation that is being sought; it could even result in a net loss of energy given its reliance on traditional pumping to higher elevations. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I respectfully ask that you prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Kriston Ryan in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056. Submission Date: 3/22/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kriston Ryan, PHOENICIA, NY.

Hello,

There appear to be material errors in an Amendment filed to this docket dated January 21, 2021; the amendment is identified with a document accession number: &#34;20210201-5022&#34; for FERC project number 15056. In the aforementioned document section titled &#34;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY 18 C.F.R. § 4.32(a)&#34; it is stated: &#34;Every city, town or similar local political subdivision:
(A) In which any part of the project, and any Federal facilities that would be used by the project, would be located&#34; and DOES NOT go on to identify the county, town, or locality of Lanesville, NY, located in the Town of Hunter in Greene County, where the same document proposes a 245-acre reservoir and associated dam.

The wetted footprint of the proposed reservoir, shown later in Exhibit 3 of the same document, would include a small rural town center and the sole arterial road (NY-214) that provides access to the residents of the Stony Clove valley, including my business. To the extent of my knowledge, neither the residents of the directly affected and adjacent areas nor the leadership at the town and county level have been informed of this proposal. 

This reservoir would require the removal or destruction of currently-occupied homes and places of business and it would have direct adverse impact on my business. The community members have not been given their due as stakeholders.

Sincerely,

Eric Ansanelli</pre><hr><b>Comments of Cindy Flamenhaft under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/18/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Cindy Flamenhaft, West Hurley, NY.
This is a massive project that is being proposed in a quiet, residential area which is being over-run with corporations looking to cash in on the beautiful lands and natural resources. It is obviously a concern to local residents. Unfortunately, due to poor planning, tonight’s meeting was set up on a platform that could only accommodate 100 participants.

I have learned that your company has proposed a feasibility study for a pumped storage facility in the Ashokan reservoir region and I must strenuously object. The region you are considering bringing this to is a State Forest Preserve with the highest possible protective status (Status One) as designated by the USGS. You should have been aware of that from the outset, and so I wonder at the potential for other flaws in your proposal. The region is one of the rarest preserves in New York State of natural forest, with protected wildlife, flora and fauna. This is a rural area with small narrow roads, as well, and any construction through this region would be completely unfeasable. I have very deep concerns about this destructive proposal, and I will make my opinion known to all parties involved.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Natalie Korniloff under P-15056.

It is ridiculous that a company from another state is proposing something that the community hasn&#39;t asked for or needs.  My understanding is that the facility itself will generate 2800 MW but only 800MW go to the community, which I assume we will have to pay for via our electric bill.  My other understanding is that the other 2000MW will be used to run the facility. What is our community to gain??  There will be a huge disruption to the community and ecology of the area. For what?  It can be assumed that this intruding company will somehow make a profit on the back of our community.  Essentially:  How dare they..??</pre><hr><b>Comments of Skye Owens under P-15056.

The areas where these proposed sites exist are all on private land meaning the destroying of property and revenue driving activities for our towns and local businesses.
We rely on tourism dollars in the Catskills such as hiking, snow sports, hunting, fishing, fly fishing, geo studies, educational camps, and scenic byways like 214 through Lanesville.
Please reconsider this project on NY STATE LAND, not private property.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Oksana Nichols under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/19/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Oksana Nichols, Olivebridge, NY.
Hi, my name is Oksana Nichols. I have 
Been a full time resident at 2303 State Rt 28A, Olivebridge, NY 12461 for the past 17 years. This is one of the most unique places in NYS. Besides being beautiful in any time of the year, its home to some protected species, like timber rattle snakes, bold eagles, eastern hognose snake, bog orchid. Many local creeks and brooks are both trout waters and trout spawning habitats. The Ashokan pumped storage project / FERC project # P-15056 is deficient since it is not a closed loop project, as it involves addition of another reservoir, this project is deceitful and potentially comes in direct conflict with The US Constitution, as the area proposed for the development in FERC project # P-15056 is part of Catskills Forrest Preserve, created by Constitution in 1885. The Ashokan pumped water storage project will increase the turbidity of the water, thus decreasing the quality of the drinking water NYS wide, and affecting trout natural environment. Please, do not allow FERC project # P-15056 go any further and do not grant preliminary license.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Amy Barkow under P-15056.

As a part-time resident of the Woodland Valley in Phoenicia, NY (one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity), I categorically object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do everything in its power to deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, expensive and unnecessary. If allowed to proceed, it will destroy or cause longterm damage to local lands, streams and native wildlife, require massive road and infrastructural reconstruction and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for more than nine million people in New York City. I strongly oppose this proposal and urge the FERC to do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.​

We own a home in one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity.

We need constant access to this house, as, being senior citizens, we shelter there during COVID spikes in the greater NY area. I strongly object to the proposal. It defies common sense. I ask that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. Their proposed for-profit project is likely to damage local homes, roads, bridges, and streams in the area, plus denying local merchants and workers their much-needed seasonal income from tourism, skiing, and sport fishing. The increased turbidity in waters will also threaten the unfiltered drinking water source for 9,000,000&#43; residents of New York City. Therefore, the project benefits no one in NY State except its investors, if any such exist outside of PEH&#39;s California-based business. Please do everything possible to stop this ill-conceived proposal now.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion><div class=card><div class=card-header id=headerDOCX17><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapseDOCX17 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapseDOCX17>

As a resident of Woodland Valley, one of the locations being proposed by
Premium Energy Holdings of California as a site for a large reservoir,
for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity_,_ I vigorously
object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary
permit.

In addition to dispossessing hundreds of homeowners, this reservoir
would inundate and flood the valley’s current water way--Woodland Brook,
a trout stream and tributary to the Esopus Creek. It is a special and
beautiful stream.

John Burroughs, the 19^(th) century naturalist and author, wrote of
discovering the brook for the first time:

But the prettiest thing was the stream soliloquizing in such musical
tones there amid the moss-covered rocks and boulders. How clean it
looked, what purity! Civilization corrupts the streams as it corrupts
the Indian; only in such remote woods can you now see a brook in all its
original freshness and beauty. Only the sea and the mountain forest
brook are pure; all between is contaminated more or less by the work of
man. An ideal trout brook was this, now hurrying, now loitering, now
deepening around a great boulder, now gliding evenly over a pavement of
green-gray stone and pebbles; no sediment or stain of any kind, but
white and sparkling as snow-water, and nearly as cool. Indeed, the water
of all this Catskill region is the best in the world. For the first few
days, one feels as if he could almost live on the water alone.; he
cannot drink enough of it. In this particular it is indeed the good
bible land, “a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that
spring out of valleys and hills.”

The brook is the particular reason many of the valley’s homeowners chose
to live there. And when it comes their time to die, rather than be
consigned to a cemetery, their emotional attachment is such that they
prefer to have their ashes joined with the brook.

I make no apology for waxing poetic about my boyhood stream. It would be
a sin, a travesty, to permit an energy company to decimate Woodland
Brook. What follows will give you a further idea of how I feel on the
subject.

Thank you.

J. Michael O’Neil

WOODLAND BROOK

Thoughts of the brook consume me.

There’s early spring, when the water runs

Fast and blue and the shadblow blooms pure white

All along the valley corridor.

My father directs me to use a quill Gordon.

Iron Fraudator hatches while the last

Thin snow falls.

Grandpa was right.

Life is not all skittles and beer.

Even on a bright Memorial Day,

You can find evidence of Winter’s

Harsh directive.

The stench of rotting flesh hits us

Like a wall, as we crash through

Sinewy brush, lugging heavy buckets

Of stocking trout.

The doe’s body was hidden in deep water,

Until this sudden dry spell.

Lately she has become the uncontested property,

Of recalcitrant valley dogs and buzzflies.

In summer the brook dwindles to a crystalline trickle,

Under a demanding sun, grasshoppers bask

In the hot dust and fiddle beneath the black-eyed suzies.

Cautious trout maintain themselves in the shade

Of willows and smooth children’s jumping rocks

They wait for nighttime when they will fill with

Brash courage and feed in a frenzy on top.

Take your rod and visit them then.

To Hell with the cocktail hour.

Cold wet autumn, when the slate drakes hatch

Leaving their skinhusks behind like gossamer souvenirs of their

First life. As May flies, they flutter off through the rain

To begin their brief climactic last-life.

There is the Grandparent’s pool,

Where we laid my parents’ ashes,

First his in his year of death, then her’s.

Angler’s ashes in the waters they loved.

The brook holds them and venerates them,

As do we.

To Whom it May Concern,

RE: Docket P-15056

     As a resident of Olive for 27 years whose property is on both sides of the Mettacahonts Creek, I realize the fragility of our precious eco- system and strongly oppose this unnecessary hydro project. The amount of digging and construction in the fragile area proposed would permanently dislodge wildlife, the flora and fauna and countless other forms of life.  
   The Catskills are rich with many smaller streams that are part of the Hudson Valley watershed that are always running. These could easily support a host of micro hydro projects installed by individual home owners that could provide reliable electricity to the area.  
    This project is a bad idea for this area and I strongly oppose it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Oscar Ogg under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/17/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Oscar Ogg, Olivebridge, NY.

To my dear fellow human beings,

My family has been blessed with a humble home on Woodland Valley Stream for over 50 years.

Woodland Valley is a very special place, with irreplaceable value in the ecosystem, the history, and the ongoing community of the entire Hudson Valley.  Its beauty and value cannot be overstated.

We invite any associates of the PSP Ashokan Pumped Storage Project to come visit and stay with us, so that we may offer you a view of the magic that Woodland Valley offers to those who can respect it.

We open our home to you, in the hope that you will open your heart to Woodland Valley Stream.

In the time we have lived there, we have witnessed an ongoing natural reclamation of a vast ecosystem, hosting myriad stories of life and regeneration.  

This area has been torn apart again and again by human development over the last few centuries, and it deserves the chance to have time to grow back into what it could be again, without the threat of yet another usurious human endeavor poisoning and pillaging its resources.

We locals have seen the way the river naturally flushes itself on an irregular and unpredictable basis, and the unquestionable value of flooding.  Any reservoir at this elevation would most likely be a fool’s undertaking.  We have watched bridges and homes get washed away in the various moods of the stream, and we have learned to respect the power of the water’s choices in its flow.

The stream’s flooding is a phenomenon of nature, and therefore something intrinsically vital to the health of the whole area’s ecosystem.  

To install an artificial device like a dam would surely create something akin to a malignant abscess in a quiet and sacred part of nature.  
 

Please come visit us and let us show you what you can help preserve!

What about the disruption this project will surely have on the quality of the drinking water of NYC’s 18,800,000&#43; residents??  

NYC enjoys some of the cleanest water in the world, filtered by the very stream this project would invade.  Putting any industrial development between the Big Apple and its nourishment would potentially create havoc.  I wouldn’t envy you if your project ever affects the drinking water of those 18 million people.   

And I, personally, have spent many years in California, the source of the energy group proposing to “develop” our area.

I have seen what their reservoirs have done to the countryside out there.

I have seen where they have destroyed so much of their own ecosystems under the guise of “enlightened energy”.  Not only are their reservoirs of water unnecessary out here on the east coast, where we get rain all year long, they are also detrimental to the natural order.

With the decimation of so many fish species, with the destruction of so much riparian habitat, and with wildfires that will burn into history books, the management of water in California has not worked out well.  Now a California power company wants to bring their model here?   

No, thank you.

I invite you all to come visit us, personally, at Woodland Valley. Please come stay with my family and me*. Let us show you the deep value of this very special place.  You will leave with a brighter heart, I assure you.

After a brief visit, you will not only choose to let it be as it is, you will not want to leave.  We will show you some of the good things of what life can be about. 

With hope and gratitude,

The Walker/Halsted Clan,

P-15056-000DOCKET (NUMBER would not come up.) Proposed Hydro electric power Plant abutting Ashokan Reservoir:
Comment is made by a Catskill resident of 30 years, whose home abuts the confluence of Esopus Creek at the Woodland Valley Stream.  I have witnessed major disruptions on the creek many times during high flow events, which include scouring of stream banks, erosion to home and property, and damage to local roads and bridges.  We all have deep respect for the power of water in a storm event. These streams and valleys have taken water flows for thousands of years, and as such have evolved to a high degree of inter-related dependency. Any major change to these streams will have impacts that cannot be estimated and are not worth the risk to the delicate eco-balance that Catskill and NYS residents have determined to preserve by state law over 100 years ago.
Several points about the plan occur to me: It doesn’t look like a “closed” loop plan but looks to be an “open” loop plan, so I am suggesting that be correctly identified to get the correct name in place. I wonder why there was such a major mis- approbation ?
That being said, in regards to putting a reservoir in the Woodland Valley end, or anywhere located in this watershed region,  I have witnessed the deep micro-environmental interdependence of rain, streams, flooding, habitat with animal and human.  These dependencies have evolved in a protective way ever since the Catskill State Forest Preserve was designated protected “wild” by the NYS laws.  To change that would require a citizen amendment, and most would not agree to that- as all who come here place great value on the size of this precious forest, and nature of this protection.
The nature of rain fall, on deep valley streams made of glacial clay is one of delicate balance. 
The continuity and amount of water that empties into the Esopus, cannot be discounted, and are home and habitat to mallards, salamanders, mink, and turtle and frogs.  These creatures are the pillars of the forest floor and need protection from disrupted surfaces of ther ground in the forest. Massive rain fall runs quickly off the steep sides as creeks rise fast and furious.  Just as quickly going down.  a large area unforested such as a reservoir could disrupt the cloud eco-system and rain fall we are so dependent on.

The amount of disruption will cause more erosion on stream banks, disturbance to habitat for animals, and trout, and threaten human structures of homes, roads and bridges.  Turbidity in the water occurs any time water levels exceed the norm, and therefore impact 9 million in NYC.  Water quality is also of import to local residents who depend on clean water to drink.  Turbidity is of a great concern and is easily stirred up.
I believe this proposed project will have enormous impact on the above relationships causing major change in the balancing of the eco systems involved. 

Cycles of seasons have their own specific times of threat- snow melt, spring run off, dry conditions, and drought.  All these situations cause flooding, fire risk, depletion of food sources for animals and birds, and threat to the stream ecology.  Any large intrusion such as a new reservoir put in the basin between two major mountains and an underground channel will bring about unwanted change such as:
species dislocation, fragmenting of forest canopy thus making it difficult for some bird species to thrive such as wood thrush scarlet tanager.  NYS Audubon designated the Catskills as a mature quality forest, and any fragmentation would destroy that.
Possible opportunities for invasive species to come in could occur with a large reservoir or channel tunneling. This proposed project would invite breaking up one of the most highly preserved un- interrupted forest preserves in NYS and on the Eastern coast.

Eco tourism via outdoor natural recreation like hiking, fishing, and camping has contributed to the local economy. The grand scale of this project is beyond the intimate nature of this economy and will have a negative impact on the local permanent residential economy. When residents need to turn to destruction for economic survival due to loss of tourism, that could be consider a causal effect of such a proposal such as this one. Iurge the complete review of this project especially concerning water quality, fish and bird habitat, and weconomic impacts.

Hey you, 

In regards to Docket Number P-15056-000, I, Tiffany Barringer, of the hamlet of West Shokan, strongly oppose.

I invite you to take a moment. Let your mind wander to a place nearby that you go to often that brings you peace. Could be your porch, backyard, the woods, a park, the desert, vacation area, anywhere. These spaces exist, everywhere, whether you are in California or New York City. You have one too. Imagine yourself there. Relive the moments, the memories, the feelings. You are happy. Truly happy. 

Now imagine a stranger sneaking in- and destroying it. The very place you love, the memories stored deep in your mind, in your soul. The one place you feel truly happy. 
Gone.  
Now what do you feel?

There are some things that money cannot buy.

Please, I ask that you, whoever you are, take the time to personally reach out and get to know the local people of the area you have plans to affect. This is our home. I truly believe that if we work together, then there is hope that we can all find a way to make everyone happy.

Dear FERC,
I&#39;m writing to express my concern about this proposal which would dramatically impact the area in which I live both economically and environmentally. Although I whole heartedly support clean, renewable energy sources this project as roughly outlined does not appear to take into account our existing communities residents, economies or environment, to say nothing of its potential impact on the drinking water provided by the Ashokan Reservoir which accounts for roughly 40% of the drinking water supply of New York City.

Our area has already suffered a great deal to create the Ashokan Reservoir which has left bitter memories for residents of areas that were flooded to make way for this project that benefits New York City.

However, we have also come to appreciate the beauty and recreational (and economic) opportunities created by the Ashokan Reservoir including the new and very popular Ashokan Rail Trail that opened late in 2019 to much local acclaim. Businesses have begun to pop up near its access points and we welcome it as a fitting addition that amplifies our area&#39;s reputation for conservation and natural beauty. Although I would be happy to see hydropower utilized, in general, my understanding of this proposal seems like something our region will have to fight. And fight we will... As part of the successful grassroots effort to defeat Niagara Bottling&#39;s attempt to privatize water from the nearby Cooper Lake Reservoir in Woodstock a few years ago, I have no doubt that we can scuttle this project.

I encourage you to find other, more suitable locations (ideally using firms that are based in this region and have a strong understanding of potential locations) for a project of this scale.

Sincerely,
Eve Fox</pre><hr><b>Comments of Laura Nordstrom under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/13/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Laura Nordstrom, Kingston, NY.

I strongly urge that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit for a hydroelectric project near the Ashokan Reservoir. I reside nearby and frequently use the lands near the reservoir for recreation. A large, intrusive industrial project in the neighborhood would severely affect the quality of life in the area and would be sure to result in pollution and environmental degradation in an area prized for its beauty and cleanness. In turn this could adversely affect the economy of the region which relies on its quality of life, beauty and cleanness to attract visitors and residents. The proposed project is too large for our small rural way of life and economy.

I have spent summers at our homes in Woodland Valley for 80 years; members of my family have visited there since the late 1800s.  We hope to continue spending time there for many more years. 

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  

The plan, if implemented, will severely damage many properties, as well as the roads, creeks and streams in our area.  It will endanger wildlife in the Catskill Park.  It will create excessive turbidity and endanger New York City&#39;s drinking water supply, most of which is unfiltered when it reaches residents.  And with the threat of climate change, it is unclear how such a project would be affected.  

I completely understand that creative solutions are required to meet the need.  However, this proposal has not been thought through and examined carefully.  For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water&#39;s direction is reversed. Reservoirs actually produce methane, a process that is not well understood.  The cost is way too high for the benefit realized.

I urge you to do whatever you can to block this unfortunate proposal from proceeding further. 

Thank you.

Re P-15056-000 Preliminary Permit re Ashokan

Four generations of my family have spent summers in Woodland Valley in two homes, since the 19th century, and I want to be able to bring my young children and their children there for many summers to come. I am writing to register my profound objections to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  
 
The plan, if implemented, would disrupt and damage many properties, roads, creeks and streams in our area, and endanger the wildlife in the Catskill Park. It will put a dent in tourism in the area and could foment unknown consequences as the climate change. Nine million people in New York City could be affected by endangering the water supply that springs forth from this area. 

This proposal is disingenuous and not fully transparent. For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water&#39;s direction is reversed. Reservoirs produce methane, a process that is not well understood. I understand the need for new forms of power but this is not the clean, environmentally-friendly power intended, and the damage to local economies and ecosystems far outweighs potential benefit.

Hello, 
My name is Selina and I am a Catskills native. Having grown up and still living near the shores of the Ashokan in Boiceville, I am proud of the natural wonders we have in the town of Olive. This was only recently further highlighted by the new Ashokan Rail Trail.

To the employees of the FERC who are reviewing this application, let me begin by thanking you for taking the time to allow the home and business owners near the Ashokan Reservoir the opportunity to opine on this matter. I am currently a resident of New York City, but I grew up about a mile from the Ashokan Reservoir, and I currently own a home and business within about a mile of it. That said, my primary income comes from my career in finance in New York City, so I am involved in the energy markets, including the power market to some degree. Although I am not an expert on the electricity market, I do have a reasonable understanding of how it functions, as well as many of the mechanisms that determine pricing. Based on that background, I can only conclude that it would be a tragedy if this project is approved, as it will likely create very little, if any, benefit for local residents. In fact, from the limited data provided regarding the project, it looks like the bulk of the electricity generated will be used to pump water back and forth by the company, and not for the benefit of consumers. Isn&#39;t it interesting that Premium Energy Holdings decided to submit this application without ever having discussed it with the State of New York, New York City, or the local residents? All this application says is that a company, with no history, understanding or contribution to the area, has figured out a way to make money off of a venture. This would be distasteful to anyone in any town, but it is particularly obnoxious given the significant amounts of taxpayer money that goes to maintaining the Ashokan Reservoir, and the surrounding land, in order to protect it as a primary source of drinking water for New York City. To the locals, the reservoir is very special, as it a magnificent place that not only benefits millions of residents as a source of drinking water, but also as a wonderful example of how conservation and recreation can work hand-in-hand to protect and celebrate our most precious of natural resources. All of that said, I am not debating the need for innovation, as it is at the core of the US economy. However, let&#39;s make innovation make sense. Let&#39;s approve projects that are necessary, can have a massively positive impact on society, and let&#39;s do so in a way that protects the environment. Why would we destroy forests, the habitats of native species, and deface one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in the entire State of New York in order to move forward with a project that will produce no significant benefit to anyone?

Dear Kimberly D. Bose,

I am writing to express my overwhelming opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ short-sighted plan to build a hydroelectric plant in the Ashokan Reservoir region of Ulster County.

As my parents and several members of my extended family have indicated in their own comments, our family has owned a house in Woodland Valley for more than 75 years. The house and the valley it sits in are a family heirloom. While we own the house, the valley and its natural and relaxing beauty are accessible to all and are widely utilized. The state campground at the end of Woodland Valley Road, which would become inaccessible if Premium Energy Holdings’ plan comes to fruition, is an affordable way for anyone to enjoy the idyllic mountain air, water, hiking, and fishing in Woodland Valley. It attracts thousands of visitors annually who bring with them a tremendous positive economic impact on the surrounding communities and the businesses that call those communities home. Without those visitors and all of the others who come to rent houses in the valley, those businesses and the economy of Phoenicia and the surrounding communities would suffer tremendously.

Even conducting a study on the feasibility of such a foolish project would cause serious harm to the environment and natural beauty of the region. Building the temporary roads mentioned in Premium Energy Holdings’ filing will create air, noise, and water pollution and damage the environment.

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to use eminent domain to seize privately owned land is spurious. They are a private, for-profit entity asking the state to use a provision intended for the public good of all citizens for their own private profit. Moreover, nearly 75% of the power generated by the proposed plant will go to running the plant, leaving very little to supplement the existing power grid.

Even if there is a gain in terms of cheaper or additional energy, which seems far from guaranteed given this proposal, that gain is vastly outweighed by the economic cost in acquiring the privately-owned land, by the negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, by the negative environmental impact of destroying the natural flow of the Woodland Valley Creek, and by destroying and rendering inaccessible one of the most beautiful, tranquil, peaceful places in all of the United States: Woodland Valley, New York.

I urge the FERC to stop the wasteful, unnecessary destruction of Woodland Valley before it begins. Deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal before it ruins the lives, liberties, and ability to pursue happiness of the people of the region.

Sincerely,
Seth S. Tannenbaum, Ph.D.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Alanna Steffen under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/15/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alanna Steffen, West Lafayette, IN.

Hello,

As a resident of one of the Town of Olive in NY State, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I VIGOROUSLY OBJECT to the proposal, and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission DENY Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

My name is Courtney Williams. I am a resident of Peekskill, NY, but my family has a camp in Big Indian, NY and frequent in Shandaken and the area around the Ashokan Reservoir.

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holding&#39;s plan to flood more of the area for their project.

Shandaken has already been forever altered by the formation of the Ashokan Reservoir, displacing entire communities to flood them to serve New York City.

This community objects to this project and their wishes should be respected.

Growing up I always dreamed of owning a home that became more than simply a place to live.  I wanted a place to create not just a lifetime of memories for myself but for generations of friends and family.  My family had traveled consistently throughout my childhood and I was always envious of those who had homes in which their parents (or grandparents!) grew up.

When I moved to the Catskills sixteen years ago, I didn’t have the means to achieve this but as I looked around at houses to rent, I was led by a realtor to Stoney Clove Lane.  She explained that a cabin was about to be available.  I couldn’t look inside now as it was occupied, but I could see the exterior. I didn’t even need to.  Simply driving up the road, a chill ran through my body and I realized I had found someplace truly magical.  I agreed to a year lease without ever stepping foot in the cabin.

Within two years I had become dear friends with my neighbors on all three sides.  Across the road was an incredible psychologist from the city who spent her weekends there. To my left, Jeremy Bernstein, born and raised in the Catskills, his father had founded the only private school in Woodstock in the early 60s.  Jeremy went on to become one of my closest friends, best man at my wedding, and eventually built my child his house (but I get ahead of myself).  To my right was Chuck Lankester, a fascinating man who worked in the UN for over forty years, helping shape global environmental policies, including the Kyoto Protocol, portions of which were penned on Stoney Clove Lane!  He had built his home from scratch singlehandedly back in the early seventies, over the course of three years, assisted on weekends by his two teenage daughters.  From cutting down trees to breaking rocks to create the foundation of the driveway, they worked tirelessly on this magical home they dubbed Chalabin: smaller than a chalet, bigger than a cabin.

As Chuck thought of retiring and moving South, I began thinking of marriage.  Before long, I had bought my neighbor’s home, my very first home purchase, and exchanged marital vows on the balcony.  Jeremy worked tirelessly to overhaul the house, and a little over a year later our son Woody was born.  As he got bigger and we started thinking of other children, Chalabin began to feel too small for us.  Jeremy helped us build a second home on the property and unwittingly I was slowly beginning to create the dream property I had yearned for my whole childhood.  

We’ve celebrated birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and global pandemics in this home.  We&#39;ve hosted celebrated writers and academics, painters, musicians, and filmmakers.  We’ve endured days without power where my son helped me melt snow to get drinking water, and we’ve installed a swimming pool for days when it’s just too darn hot to head down to the swimming hole.  We’ve made new friends on the road and kept in touch with old ones (Chuck came back last year with his wife and daughter to visit!).  

The idea that this home of mine--and this community which has thrived long before I arrived--is in peril breaks my heart.  It is so rare to find a place this magical, neighbors this loving and caring, a peaceful haven so pure.  Please, I implore you, do not mercilessly destroy this.  

Thank you very much for your understanding.  

Sincerely,

I am a resident of the Town of Olive, where an application for an underground hydroelectric plant, dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels as well as other equipment for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity has been made.

I strongly oppose the pumped storage system proposed for the Ashokan Reservoir/Esopus Creek area. It will negatively impact the areas in which it is proposed and as a frequent user of the Ashokan Reservoir for boating and fishing, and the Esopus Creek region for hiking and fishing it will have an undeniable negative impact on the region.

The fact that the application was made without informing local and NY City authorities of the plan before filing for permits indicates that the owners have little or no regard for the local or regional residents. I urge you to deny any permits that they have requested.

This ill-advised and poorly planned proposal does not take into account the impact of residents in the area, displacing many and impacting public lands.

March 10, 2021

Dear Ms. Bose, 
I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 
The Premium Energy Holdings project is ill conceived and unwelcome. As a 25-year resident of Moonhaw Road, one of the proposed access roads for the proposal, I can attest to the problems increasing traffic to this road would present. There is substantial pedestrian activity on our road and, with just the recent increase in FEDEX, UPS and other delivery services brought on by the pandemic, there have been many close calls between pedestrians and cars and these larger trucks. Moonhaw Road is not a wide thoroughfare. Our community will not tolerate a proposal that paints our area as sparcely-populated and defines Moonhaw Road as an “access road”.
I hope FERC will reject this proposal and get behind projects that uplift communities and give green initiatives a good name. In addition to local impact, there are several reasons why this project comes up short on an environmental impact level.
On the local level, the property values and tax revenues of the area could be severely impacted. At a time when people are becoming increasingly educated about the importance of the human impact on our natural surroundings this project will have many vocal opponents. Using terminology drawing on “imminent domain” strategies is irresponsible on the part of Premium Holdings. This community has a long history with regards to the imminent domain invoked to construct the Ashokan reservoir.
The area around the reservoir has been so jealously protected in all my years residing here: every building permit, septic system and construction project is met with scrutiny in an effort to guard against any contamination or mishap befalling the drinking water for New York City. As a community we understand the importance of our stewardship of this resource.
As for its standing as a responsible project to generate green-power, the proposal, as described is an “open-loop” project. This is not a good thing. If it moves forward, it will require the construction of an entirely new reservoir to even function and that water has to be pumped to the upper basin during non-peak hours represents the least practical and most disruptive and inefficient solution to a problem that may not even exist. Early projections by Premium Energy explain that the plant would expend 2/3rd of the energy it produces just to operate. In the process, the fossil fuels required undertake construction and the methane released from the proposed new reservoir have been left out of the proposal.  
The proposed project invites problems which would affect 9.5 million New Yorkers down-state who currently enjoy some of the best unfiltered water in the nation. As I understand it, the existing reservoir has an upper basin designed to catch sediment and keep it from the lower basin. The cycling of water to a third basin can only invite contamination from disturbed sediment. I can say from experience that the taste of New York City drinking water is absolutely affected by even subtle changes to these reservoirs as discussed in a Dec 14 article in Patch (https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/tap-water-tasting-funny-nyc-heres-why).
This proposal by Premium Energy Holdings, put forth without prior warning to the affected area or to the city, is not a local project grown out of a community’s needs and demands, it is proposed by a company 3000 miles away prospecting with no understanding of the area’s environmental, historical or economic circumstances.
As FERC advances projects in the interest of alternative energy independence in the days and decades to come, it should support those proposals that feel right and organic and sensible for the affected communities so the nation can get behind this essential move away from fossil fuels. 

Thank you for your time,

Please accept this comment as my full disapproval of the this permit application.  The planned installation of a dam and reservoir in the Woodland Valley would have devastating consequences for our community.  The planned location is very near my property and would destroy the much valued Woodland Valley landscape.  It would also have many consequences to the wild fishery population of the Woodland Valley Stream that merges with the Esopus Creek nearby thus impacting recreational fishing activities and water management.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ann Morris under P-15056.

Please do not let this  proposed plan go through. This will destroy our beautiful environment and will decimate many many people’s lives. People who have lived here for generations, as well as people who have made this their home more recently. Not to mention destroying tourism in this part of the Catskills

I am a resident of Woodland Valley, which is one of the hamlets under consideration by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam and reservoir.  Although I would be justified in vigorously objecting to this proposal as a resident whose home and neighborhood would be destroyed if this project is approved, my objections are far wider in scope.

I object to any expense incurred by Federal, State, County or Town governments in consideration of this bizarre and unbelievably misguided proposal.  My objections are on the grounds that it will negatively impact the natural assets that make this area of unique economic, scenic, recreational, and ecological value to New York and the entire Northeast region of the United States.  Here is a list of four assets (out of many more) which are under significant threat by this proposal:
1.  The water supply for 9 million people in the City of New York and surrounding New York counties.
2.  Breeding grounds for native trout species that provide a beneficial environment for the best fly-fishing recreation area in the eastern United States.
3.  The neighboring protected NYS DEC land designated as &#34;forever wild&#34; by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which enjoys the highest degree of protection of wild lands in any state.
4.  Local lands, roads, and streams that are a major economic asset supporting the larger Catskills community, and which will suffer irreparable damage.

As a resident whose family first moved to this area in 1810, I add my voice to all those who are calling on the FERC to do everything in its power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Julia Nichols under P-15056.

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley
would be flooded by this project. The Tenth Amendment provides “[t]he
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to
whether the present Supreme Court of the United States would allow this
project to proceed by use of eminent domain. The present composition of
the Court will, I believe, view the Tenth Amendment as being more
significant as applied to the facts of this situation, than prior courts
did in clearer “public use” cases and will defer to the State
Constitutional assertion of the benefit of forever wild land use.

Similarly, using or delegating eminent domain to and for a private party
for the private party’s personal profit—when the actual benefit to the
public is so speculative—raises other constitutional issues. The public
use or benefit does not flow here from the creation of the reservoir. If
there is any public benefit it would come from the private party selling
its energy. Whether that would be a public benefit would depend on what
the parties negotiate in the future. That is too speculative and
variable a bases for asserting a public benefit. The Supreme Court’s
five-to-four decision in _Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S.469(2005)_
will, in my view, not be extended by the present members of the Court
for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the
flooded property is thereafter owned by the Federal or State Government,
herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for
the majority that “a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside
the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this
case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly
raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical
cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.”
The present situation seems to present that open question. Private
property will be taken to allow another private party to make a profit
and the hoped for increase in cheap energy will be in the hands of the
second private party. Equally importantly, the four-member dissent in
_Kelo_ seems to reflect the view of the present majority of the Supreme
Court, more than does the majority opinion in _Kelo_.

My view is that the FERC should evaluate these constitutional issues
before an expensive and extensive expenditure of time and money is
wasted on a project with speculative public benefit and clearly
articulated Constitutional declared harm to public area used extensively
for the public good. Pumped storage hydro plants appear to be an
important part of our goal to use renewable energy. But the present
proposal presents a very bad set of facts upon which to proceed.</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

If permitted to go forward, it would be almost certain to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Mark M Giese in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and to cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

This ill-advised proposal for massive construction adjacent to the drinking water reservoir that supplies a portion of the water for nine million people seems totally implausible. Any reasonable ideas about generating hydroelectric from the reservoir system may now become harder to discuss, and local communities, already addressing more pressing issues, are being forced to divert attention to mobilize in opposition.

Please cancel the project.

No project should be constructed with out the buy in of local residents. The history of the reservoir system in this area is drought with controversy since a whole town was flooded to make it. There is on going guessing between residents and Nyc who owns the ashokan reservoir which will create even more mistrust and anger toward the project.

I am writing to express my dismay with Premium Energy’s application to create a pumped hydroelectric power station and set of reservoirs in the Catskill Mountain region of New York. This project would displace hundreds if not thousands of residents, and scar the beautiful and crucial wilderness areas of the region. Born and raised outside of Woodstock New York, my life has been endlessly enriched by access to these forever wild places, and they are a core aspect of our regions economy. Also, eminent domain may be an abstract concept to most communities in America, but this area still bears scars from a period of rampant land seizure associated with the construction of the NYC reservoirs a hundred years ago. Plans of this kind touch a nerve here, and I hope that FERC will recognize the substantially negative social, economic and natural impact of these plans before considering approval.

Regarding Docket # P15056-000, Application for Preliminary Permit for Document of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP under P-15056: I wish to register my objections to this project:
 
The proposal has very limited benefits (net power supply) vs the cost to the fragile, protected environment of the Catskills Park.

There would be disruption to local families and businesses. 

It was not created in cooperation with state and local government plans for use of the region

There must be other, better ways to capitalize on the flow of water through the NYC water distribution system, such as installing turbines adjacent to the aqueduct. Some parts of the aqueduct are already currently under rehabilitation. Only through consultation with the state and local authorities and utilities could these be explored.

In light of the above this proposal should be rejected based on cost/benefit, prematurity and lack of planning. Please protect the citizens of NY from this invasion and grab of property by an out-of-state private corporation.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Nian Fish in P-15056.

Re: 
P-15056.000
I vigorously object to the project proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. Premium Energy Holdings wants to create an enormous underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir. If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets, as well as damming streams to create reservoirs as part of what is called “pumped storage”  - electricity to be generated using massive water transport tunnels. Tapping into any energy generated would also require massive new high power electric transmission networks. 

Premium Energy Holdings has not reached out to New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) or the local municipalities that would be impacted by the project. Transparency has not been at the forefront of this massive undertaking and environmentally detrimental project.

Basis for Intervening:
In having read the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposal, it my sense that this project risks both the natural characteristics of this area - namely the Catskills Park protected within the New York State Constitution as &#34;forever wild&#34; - as well as the primary industry of this area - tourism.  

A large hydro-electric dam and accompanying reservoir would not merely push aside hundreds of citizens through the necessary eminent domain seizures, but would fundamentally alter the largest industry in the entire county.  Over $500 million is spent on tourism each year in Ulster County and the largest part of that is directly connected to the mountains and streams that make the Catskills once of the prettiest parts of the country.

While clean energy is always a laudable goal, this project does not provide a sufficient return, or sufficient environmental benefits to offset the loss of an entire town hamlet, the destruction of vast areas of forest, and corresponding destruction of a major section of the local and regional economy.

As a resident of Shandaken, New York, my home and livelihood are intimately connected to the watershed of our region.  In this capacity, I respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission refuse any and all permits associated with this project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jacqueline Kellachan in P-15056.

I am saddened to think what it would do to the wildlife that calls the protected reservoir property home, there are several nests of Bald Eagles very near the site, in fact the proposed power house would likely be in eye shot of one of the nests.  If the disruption to the town&#39;s people is not reason enough surly the danger it would pose to these protected species is.

Hello, I grew up in this area and still love spending time on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity.

I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, will damage local lands, roads, and streams and will negatively impact everyone living in this area of the Catskills. 

In addition, the increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for the nine million people in New York City will directly impact me, my family, and our greater community here in NYC.

I’m writing to express my opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric power station at the Ashokan Reservoir. I support sustainable energy. But this project and this company are the antithesis of green power. In other projects in the western United States, their plants have decimated fish species, putting them on the endangered species list. They deliberately target land that has Native American interests. The Sierra Club has opposed their projects after extensive analysis of the environmental impact has shown irreparable damage to the environment and the community. Why would we support this proposal or want it?

We live in a beautiful, pristine community. The Ashokan is central to living here. Please do not grant this company the right to destroy what we hold so dear.

Submission Date: 3/7/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mei Zheng, Lanesville, NY.
I question the credibility and qualifications of Victor M. Rojas and Premium Energy Holdings, LLC. Given the significant impact of this project on the local residents and the ecology of the Catskill Forest Preserve, this firm should have at a minimum given a courtesy notice to the key stakeholders - most notably the NYC Department of Environmental Protection and the local municipal governments affected prior to submitting a preliminary application. Premium Energy Holdings has a history of taking a hostile approach to these projects, including in Washoe County, Nevada, Inyo County, California and Walker Lake, Nevada without regard to environmental impact, tribal lands, or even basic feasibility analysis in a changing climate. This company surprises communities with these proposals under the guise of “renewable” energy without material considerations for cost-benefit analysis. There are red flags and severe deficiencies in the application itself. For example, the company states the location of the proposed project is strictly in Ulster County, NY. However, their proposed Stony Clove Reservoir is entirely located in Greene County. Victor M Rojas, a professional engineer swears in his application that the contents of the application are “true to the best of his knowledge or belief”. If he had done even a very basic level of research, he would find that material facts such as the geography upon which his application is based are untrue. This carelessness from the outset is a major red flag as to what other errors and omissions this firm would commit if the project were allowed to progress. 

The Ashokan Reservoir that Victor Rojas proposes to pump water out of serves New York City, the largest city in the United States. This is a valuable resource protected by the NYC DEP and cannot be subject to the fanciful whims and experimentation of a private for profit company on the other side of the country. In recent years, the Ashokan Reservoir has had low water levels due to drought. Pumping water out of the reservoir will further exacerbate this problem due to evaporation. 

The application states that the Ashokan Reservoir water levels will fluctuate by 2 feet during operation of this power plant. This significant water movement not only accelerates evaporation but further disturbs the marine life in the reservoir. The impact is not only limited to the fisheries in the reservoir but the entire food chain. For example, the Ashokan is home to a large population of bald eagles that have made a remarkable comeback in recent years and relies on the fisheries of the Ashokan Reservoir to thrive. This project will undoubtedly have adverse ecological consequences far and wide both during construction and operation. 

Let’s be clear, Premium Energy Holdings has no track record of completing ANY successful projects of this size and scope. Do not indulge Victor M. Rojas and his company in this exercise of pure hubris. 

Let us also not forget the findings in the report submitted to the United States Congress by the Staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in May 2017 titled “Report on the Pilot Two-Year Hydroelectric Licensing Process for Non-Powered Dams and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Projects and Recommendations Pursuant to Section 6 of the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013”. The report clearly outlines to developers the proper characteristics and approach they should take to licensing. 

In terms of design, “the project would not alter existing flow regimes or cause significant impoundment fluctuations; minimal land clearing would be required; and for projects at non-federal dams, the existing structures satisfy the Commission’s Dam Safety Guidelines.” Premium Energy Holdings is seeking to significantly alter the existing flow regimes of the Stony Clove Creek,  impound water over the major New York State highway NY-214, necessitating this highway to be rerouted, and clear hundreds of acres of land in the Catskill Forest Preserve protected as “forever wild” by Article XIV of the NYS Constitution. 

In terms of environmental characteristics, “there are few, or only minor environmental concerns, for example: there would be no significant change to water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature; the project would not significantly alter the flow regime at the project site; there would be little or no potential for project effects on migratory fish; and there would be no adverse effects on federally listed species and/or
habitat”. The sites proposed by Premium Energy Holdings have exceptional scenic, recreational, and ecological value according to the NYS DEC. Premium Energy Holdings’ proposed dam construction and up to 13&#43; miles of tunneling will undoubtedly have both severe immediate and residual adverse environmental consequences. 

In terms of information gathering and consultation, “stakeholders, especially agencies, are consulted early, and frequently during the term of the preliminary permit and pre-filing to identify, and reach a consensus on, appropriate environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement (PM&amp;E) measures that address project-related impacts. Premium Energy Holdings has made NO effort to notify nor consult the relevant stakeholders including the NYC DEP which owns the lands of the Ashokan Reservoir. 

In summary, Premium Energy Holdings has NO TRACK RECORD of successful projects of this size or scope, has failed to demonstrate the proper characteristics required of such a project, and has failed to take the proper approach to undertaking such a project. Victor Rojas and his firm has further demonstrated a lack of sufficient understanding of the sites based on deficiencies in his application and has repeated these failures in other sites around the country. Based on this, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should promptly deny Premium Energy Holdings’ application for a Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Sophia Sagan in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

Hi, I live in an area near the Ashokan Reservoir and I wanted to submit a comment about the proposed pumped storage facility. Supporting renewable energy is a good thing! but I am concerned about any unintended consequences.
The surveying and construction would obviously disrupt the land and wildlife of the area, so it needs to be determined whether that will all be worth it. The project should be sustainable and efficient while not significantly disrupting the landscape, wildlife, and community of the area. The local residents should also be involved in the process, and make sure the project will benefit the local community in the long term. And if not, alternative projects should be considered.

Basis for Intervening:
The City of New York (“City”) seeks to intervene in this proceeding on its own behalf and on behalf of the nine million people who rely on a daily basis on the City’s water supply system.  The City owns the Ashokan Reservoir, which comprises a large part of the proposed pump storage facility and is an important component of the City’s water supply system.  The City uses the Ashokan Reservoir to supply approximately 40% of the daily water supply needs of its approximately nine million customers.  The outcome of this proceeding could have a direct and significant impact on the City’s water supply system and its ability to serve its customers’ needs.  Accordingly, the City has a substantial interest in this matter.  No other party represents the City’s interests, and no other party reasonably could do so.  The City’s participation in this proceeding is therefore essential to ensure that the interests and concerns of the City and its constituents and customers are heard by the Commission.  The City also submits that its participation will help to advance the public interest.  For the forgoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion><div class=card><div class=card-header id=headerPDF26><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapsePDF26 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapsePDF26>

Some studies suggest hydropower may not be as harmless to the environment as fossil fuels. If hydropower is not more effective as a power source, and even the preliminary tests to see how viable a pump is at the Ashokan reservoir will screw up the ecology here, I suggest it will be detrimental to the community, and that the local government should not allow this to happen in a place that emphasizes preservation of the land.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Wendy Simon in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I do not believe it would be in the area&#39;s best interest to grant this permit. If approved, the proposed project would cause ecological damage to the forests, streams, and wildlife in the area.  The permit would allow for the destruction of trees and for the construction of roads, as well as the use of explosives.  In my opinion, the risks will greatly outweigh any benefit.

Given the paucity of information and (intentional?)lack of spatial specificity as to exactly what the agency&#39;s proposal is or might be, it is difficult to fully assess the potential impacts that such an outrageous and seeming poorly planed project might have (what type of idiots do they think their pitching to, to suggest that the development they propose could be done for $5mil?!!!). But intentionally disturbing the NYC water supply by such a shabby group (as evidenced by simple Google searches, showing they&#39;ve earned the title of &#34;whack-a-dam&#34;), with such a poor reputation across the country, for attempting, willy-nilly, to insert the very same type of for-cash scam, alone seems like sufficient reason to deny any further progress of the proposal. As an earth scientist with a graduate degree and 20&#43; years experience, I&#39;d immediately be greatly concerned about the potential negative impacts and disturbance of the NYC impoundments and infrastructure caused by the apparent proposed penetration of associated ground water systems and surrounding surficial and bedrock geological underpinnings. 

This apparently foreign, for-profit corporation seeking to derive shareholder benefits at the expense and great risk to the NYC DEP and millions of NYC residents must be turned back. Or at the very least be required to conduct a *full* NYS SEQRA impact assessment, accompanied by full public hearings and reviews, before being allowed one inch of forward motion.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion></div></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header28><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse28 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse28>

Opposition to Premium Energy’s Proposed Underground Power Station

To:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
From:  Robert S. Tannenbaum, 2414 Lake Park Road #2108, Lexington, KY 40502 and
				       848 Woodland Valley Road, Phoenicia, NY 12464
Re:  Docket number P-15056-000


I am unequivocally opposed to the underground power station proposed by Premium Energy of California.

I and all the other individuals or entities who might be affected have received no notice of the proposal by Premium Energy of California to create an underground power station at the Ashokan Reservoir in Ulster County, NY.  The proposal would also entail a new dam at one of three sites upstream from the reservoir and the consequent destructive flooding of an existing valley.  Our only notice is an article in the Kingston (NY) Daily Freeman ( https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/underground-power-station-proposed-on-ashokan-reservoir-property/article_5c328780-72f0-11eb-a379-8bdd4a547ba5.htm), which notes that the City of New York Department of Environmental Protection also was never notified.

The proposed plant appears to be strikingly inefficient.  Only about 25% of the electricity it would generate (800 of the 2,800 megawatts) would be available to the grid.  The remaining 75% would be used to operate the plant.  Furthermore, there was no evidence provided that these 800 megawatts are required or that they were unavailable from other existing sources.  

I am not qualified to argue the engineering failings of the proposed plant, although they do appear to be numerous.  However, I can emphatically argue against it on practical, aesthetic, and personal grounds.

In order to create this inefficient and unnecessary plant, the article indicates that one of the possible dam sites for an “upper reservoir” is in the “Woodland Valley, near Muddy Brook Road.”   A dam at that location would destroy one of the most beautiful, historic, and peaceful streams and valleys in the Catskills.

The Woodland Valley and the Woodland Creek that created it were a favorite of the famous naturalist John Burroughs.  He often hiked there in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  He wrote about it in various of his books, most notably when telling of his climbing of Slide Mountain and then descending into the Valley.  His love of the Valley for its natural beauty was shared by many others in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who made it their home (seasonal or year-round), including painters, musicians, and those who loved and appreciated nature.

My parents were among those who fell in love with the Valley.  More than seventy-five years ago, in 1945, they purchased one of the oldest farm houses in the Valley. We believe that it is the second oldest home still standing.  We know that our house was in existence during the Crimean War (1853-56), because newspaper clippings with dispatches from that war were used as insulation in some of the walls.  Growing up, I spent all of my summers there, wading, swimming, and fishing in the Woodland Creek.  Both of my sons and both of my grandsons also waded, swam, and fished there.  I hope that someday my great grandchildren will be able to do the same.  

However, if Premium Energy is allowed to build its dam, my dreams for my progeny and the dreams of all of my neighbors will never materialize.  Our house may be inaccessible and the Woodland Creek will be forever altered.  The Valley is a thriving community with hundreds of homes, a State Park, and hiking trails that are used by people from all over the eastern United States.  All of this will be obliterated.

In addition, destruction of the Woodland Valley would certainly have an enormous negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, especially the Village of Phoenicia, just a mile from the head of the Valley and home to a renowned annual vocal music festival.  The resultant loss of thousands of annual tourists and hikers, in addition to all of the homeowners, could be devastating to the economy of that village (and the others within a ten-mile radius) that are dependent on both local and transient business.  

I can find no possible excuse (except, perhaps, stockholder profits) for the wanton destruction of such a natural wonder as the Woodland Valley and its Creek.  The same can certainly be said for the two other suggested sites for the “upper reservoir.”  

I am in favor of making maximum use of environmentally-friendly sources of power, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric.  However, I am never in favor of such sources if they damage or destroy natural beauty or existing communities.  For example, I am delighted that we have no huge wind turbines high on the mountains in the Catskill Park, even though they might generate a significant amount of electricity.  The tops of our mountains are to be “forever wild,” as dictated by the Constitution of New York State.  The same should be the case for our valleys.  They must never be wantonly flooded and destroyed for the sake of a (relatively) small amount of power and the profits of some non-resident stockholders.

We are facing just another example of the demolition of the environment in the name of energy.  This threat is analogous to what has happened in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia with the destruction of the mountains through mountain top removal coal mining.  What has been lost there can never be retrieved or replaced.  We must not let the same devastation occur in the valleys of the Catskills.

I urge the Commission in the strongest possible terms to reject this proposal and never let the project proceed.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion></div></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header29><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse29 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse29>

Dear FERC,

Smart renewable energy initiatives are critical to our country’s long term future stability. I support novel strategies on how we shift away from fossil fuels using hydro, wind, tidal, solar, and even nuclear to become energy independent as a country.

The Ashokan reservoir watershed is not a warranted place for a large scale hydro-battery type project. The proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings for the Ashokan PSP is nothing short of ludicrous to see  in 2021. Habitat, residences, history, recreation, geology will be disrupted in a NYC drinking water zone.  

From reporting on the subject,  it seems that the impacted communities and counties and even NYC were not advised that someone was paying for this study and application to take place. If this is the public rollout of this radical proposal,, what does that say about the motives of the company and funded behind it - or their ability to take on something as complex as what is being proposed. 

As a New York resident and someone who already lives down stream of the effects of the western Catskills Delaware reservoirs Please do not advance this proposal.

Dear Ms. Bose

This is a filing concerning docket # P-15056-000.

My family has had a home in the Woodland Valley near Phoenicia, NY for 75 years. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Please do not allow Premium Energy to destroy this piece of paradise with an unnecessary power plant reservoir. Let Premium Energy make (or lose) their money someplace else. The plan to make a reservoir in the Woodland Valley would not only destroy our homestead but would desecrate an area of spectacular natural beauty. It must not be allowed to happen. Do not let the bulldozers into our valley. Be proactive! Stop Premium Energy now.

Thank you.

Hi,

I have a property with woodland valley creek access as part of my lot.
I object to the project of using Woodland Valley as a smaller reservoir for the Ashokan Reservoir.
I would not be able to live on my property and your project would endanger the life of animals of the state land adjacent to my property.

Please showcase that you have made a study on economical impact and natural impact of such project.

To whom it may concern,

I OPPOSE this project. My family has owned a home on Woodland Valley for over 100 years.  Built by my Great Grandfather.  I go every summer for the past 40 years to visit.  I have seen first hand how delicate the balance is on Woodland Creek between normal and floods.  A simple search would show you the damage that was done in the last major flood.  With climate change a fact and expecting more severe weather, we should NOT be changing anything with the water around Woodland Valley.  

It is a fact that Hydro-Power plants are more damaging to the environment than Wind or Solar.   We should be looking into those solutions and not something like this.   A tunnel?  Connecting Water?  A new dam?  In an area prone to flooding?  This is a disaster in the making.   Causing damage to property and the plants and animals that live in the area.  

Do not approve this project.   It will have lasting negative impact to a beautiful natural habitat that should be protected and not destroyed.   

Thank you,

Daming Woodland valley to create an upper pool would disrupt more citizens than it would serve. 

As a Chemical Engineer, I am currently collecting facts to quantify the damage the upper pool would create versus the benefit of power generation. 

Our team, located in the Wool\dand Valley, will submit additional comments once we have more information.

At first glance, the proposal is reckless and poorly thought through.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Stephen Ruehle in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056. Submission Date: 3/1/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Stephen Ruehle, Poughkeepsie, NY.
FERC P-15056-000 Ashokan Pumped Storage project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings

I am a landowner downstream of the proposed Stony Clove Reservoir. I have three areas of concern with this project.

First, the Stony Clove Creek has experienced four (4) 100 year floods in the past 10 years. These floods have reached a discharge rate of just under 20,000 cubic feet per second. The proposed reservoir will consist of a 212 high  2,618 foot long dam holding over 950 million cubic feet of water. Any failure of this dam will be catastrophic to the hamlets of Lanesville, Chichecter, and Phoenicia along the Stony Clove. It would also impact hamlets of Mt Tremper and Boiceville on the Esopus Creek.

Second, a 13.9 mile 34 foot diameter tunnel is proposed to connect the proposed reservoir to the power generating station. The proposal does not state how deep underground this tunnel will be placed. The tunnel corridor runs through the hamlets of Lanesville, Chichecter, Phoenicia, Mt Tremper, and Boiceville. The wells for the hunderds of properties needs to be considered. Will the tunnel cut through existing wells? Will the tunnel construction damage the aquifer that supplies these wells? What mitigation plans will protect the water supply to these properties?

Third, this project contains an unprecedented amount of construction within the New York City watershed. Not only will dams and tunnels need to be created, but also town roads and NY State Route 214 will need to be relocated to make room for the proposed reservoir. The proposal implies that the Stony Clove reservoir would be on state lands. However a closer look at the details reveals the reservoir would be located just above Lanseville on private land and that NY Route 214 would have to be relocated up the mountain onto state lands that are designate wilderness within the Catskill Park.

This project has a limited benefit for the general public. It will only generate a net 800 mw to be offered to the New York electrical grid. Yet the project imposes a large negative impact on local property owners in terms of long term flood risk and risk to drinking water supply.</pre><hr><h2>Other formats</h2><div class=accordion></div></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header31><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse31 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse31>

I am writing regarding the Ashokan Reservoir plans to build a hydro plant.  first of all, I would not want to drink water that was residing above a hydro plant, I would imagine there are risk with this.  Secondly, these projects sometime fail and the risk to the local environment, ecological systems would be devastating as well as having no water for NYC residents.  
Im sure there must be a healthier, less toxic way of creating energy...solar, wind power as it is very windy up here.  Im sure an architect could draw up a simple plan of covering the wind power so that they don&#39;t ice up like they did in Texas.  
I personally feel as if the government just randomly makes decisions not taking all into account of the devastation if there is an accident.  I guess if you don&#39;t live here, you don&#39;t care.
Just my two cents,

  Premium Energy Holdings, LLC   Project No.   15056-000
  ------------------------------ ------------- -----------

NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY PERMIT APPLICATION ACCEPTED FOR FILING AND
SOLICITING COMMENTS, MOTIONS TO INTERVENE, AND COMPETING APPLICATIONS

(February 11, 2020)

On November 19, 2020, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, filed an application
for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project to be located 14 miles west of the City of Kingston in
Ulster County, New York. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
