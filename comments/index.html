to live there. And when it comes their time to die, rather than be
consigned to a cemetery, their emotional attachment is such that they
prefer to have their ashes joined with the brook.

I make no apology for waxing poetic about my boyhood stream. It would be
a sin, a travesty, to permit an energy company to decimate Woodland
Brook. What follows will give you a further idea of how I feel on the
subject.

Thank you.

WOODLAND BROOK

Thoughts of the brook consume me.

There’s early spring, when the water runs

Fast and blue and the shadblow blooms pure white

All along the valley corridor.

My father directs me to use a quill Gordon.

Iron Fraudator hatches while the last

Thin snow falls.

Grandpa was right.

Life is not all skittles and beer.

Even on a bright Memorial Day,

You can find evidence of Winter’s

Harsh directive.

The stench of rotting flesh hits us

Like a wall, as we crash through

Sinewy brush, lugging heavy buckets

Of stocking trout.

The doe’s body was hidden in deep water,

Until this sudden dry spell.

Lately she has become the uncontested property,

Of recalcitrant valley dogs and buzzflies.

In summer the brook dwindles to a crystalline trickle,

Under a demanding sun, grasshoppers bask

In the hot dust and fiddle beneath the black-eyed suzies.

Cautious trout maintain themselves in the shade

Of willows and smooth children’s jumping rocks

They wait for nighttime when they will fill with

Brash courage and feed in a frenzy on top.

Take your rod and visit them then.

To Hell with the cocktail hour.

Cold wet autumn, when the slate drakes hatch

Leaving their skinhusks behind like gossamer souvenirs of their

First life. As May flies, they flutter off through the rain

To begin their brief climactic last-life.

There is the Grandparent’s pool,

Where we laid my parents’ ashes,

First his in his year of death, then her’s.

Angler’s ashes in the waters they loved.

The brook holds them and venerates them,

As do we.

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley
would be flooded by this project. The Tenth Amendment provides “[t]he
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to
whether the present Supreme Court of the United States would allow this
project to proceed by use of eminent domain. The present composition of
the Court will, I believe, view the Tenth Amendment as being more
significant as applied to the facts of this situation, than prior courts
did in clearer “public use” cases and will defer to the State
Constitutional assertion of the benefit of forever wild land use.

Similarly, using or delegating eminent domain to and for a private party
for the private party’s personal profit—when the actual benefit to the
public is so speculative—raises other constitutional issues. The public
use or benefit does not flow here from the creation of the reservoir. If
there is any public benefit it would come from the private party selling
its energy. Whether that would be a public benefit would depend on what
the parties negotiate in the future. That is too speculative and
variable a bases for asserting a public benefit. The Supreme Court’s
five-to-four decision in _Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S.469(2005)_
will, in my view, not be extended by the present members of the Court
for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the
flooded property is thereafter owned by the Federal or State Government,
herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for
the majority that “a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside
the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this
case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly
raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical
cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.”
The present situation seems to present that open question. Private
property will be taken to allow another private party to make a profit
and the hoped for increase in cheap energy will be in the hands of the
second private party. Equally importantly, the four-member dissent in
_Kelo_ seems to reflect the view of the present majority of the Supreme
Court, more than does the majority opinion in _Kelo_.

My view is that the FERC should evaluate these constitutional issues
before an expensive and extensive expenditure of time and money is
wasted on a project with speculative public benefit and clearly
articulated Constitutional declared harm to public area used extensively
for the public good. Pumped storage hydro plants appear to be an
important part of our goal to use renewable energy. But the present
proposal presents a very bad set of facts upon which to proceed.</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

NATHAN DERSHOWITZ

Basis for Intervening:
NATHAN DERSHOWITZ seeks to intervene in this proceeding. He is a
landowner in Woodland Valley and if the Woodland Valley site is chosen,
he will no longer have access to his property. Accordingly, Nathan
Dershowitz has a substantial interest in this matter. No other party
represents Nathan Dershowitz, and no other party is authorized to
represent Mr. Dershowitz’s unique interests. For the foregoing reasons,
Mr. Dershowitz respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission grant this motion to intervene.

Merits objection.

As I understand the Preliminary Permit application, a private party,
Premium Energy Holding, seeks to secure the federal eminent domain power
to potentially flood a large section of Woodland Valley. The claimed
purpose is to store water to supplement energy needs. The proposal does
not make clear who would own the condemned property. More importantly,
it is unclear as to whether there will be any public benefit from this
project. The proponent is a for-profit entity and will presumably sell
the energy to the city, state or federal Government. Thus, this proposal
is not a standard creation of a reservoir, for a public use or the
public good. It is a private entities effort to make money. The project
will not create additional energy, but by arbitrage, the private company
will make money and may or may not make energy minimally cheaper for the
public. Even if sold at a cheap price the economic benefit to the public
seems disproportionately low, compared to the cost and public harm of
this project. This and other legitimate objections have and will be
raised throughout these proceedings by me and others.

I write now to raise additional constitutional objections. First,
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states ‘nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’ By its
terms, the Fifth Amendment does not authorize the taking of state land
by eminent domain. Here, the New York State Constitution Article XIV
makes certain State land forever wild. The State Constitution requires
that certain state land shall not be taken by any corporation, public or
private. To circumvent this provision is a long and timely process,
which very rarely is successful. Some State land in Woodland Valley
would be flooded by this project. The Tenth Amendment provides “[t]he
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” The issue of whether, even if prior Supreme Court
decisions would allow Federal eminent domain to be used over the
objection of a state for the confiscation of state land, the present
proposal is extremely suspect as a basis for exercising eminent domain
over State land now being used for the public good. The “public use”
requirement of the Fifth Amendment is hard to justify here and the State
Constitutional establishment of the public good of keeping the property
forever wild cannot be ignored. There are serious questions as to
whether the present Supreme Court of the United States would allow this
project to proceed by use of eminent domain. The present composition of
the Court will, I believe, view the Tenth Amendment as being more
significant as applied to the facts of this situation, than prior courts
did in clearer “public use” cases and will defer to the State
Constitutional assertion of the benefit of forever wild land use.

Similarly, using or delegating eminent domain to and for a private party
for the private party’s personal profit—when the actual benefit to the
public is so speculative—raises other constitutional issues. The public
use or benefit does not flow here from the creation of the reservoir. If
there is any public benefit it would come from the private party selling
its energy. Whether that would be a public benefit would depend on what
the parties negotiate in the future. That is too speculative and
variable a bases for asserting a public benefit. The Supreme Court’s
five-to-four decision in _Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S.469(2005)_
will, in my view, not be extended by the present members of the Court
for a private-to-private transfer in the present situation. Even if the
flooded property is thereafter owned by the Federal or State Government,
herein a private purpose is afoot. Justice Stevens expressly noted for
the majority that “a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside
the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this
case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly
raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot, the hypothetical
cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.”
The present situation seems to present that open question. Private
property will be taken to allow another private party to make a profit
and the hoped for increase in cheap energy will be in the hands of the
second private party. Equally importantly, the four-member dissent in
_Kelo_ seems to reflect the view of the present majority of the Supreme
Court, more than does the majority opinion in _Kelo_.

My view is that the FERC should evaluate these constitutional issues
before an expensive and extensive expenditure of time and money is
wasted on a project with speculative public benefit and clearly
articulated Constitutional declared harm to public area used extensively
for the public good. Pumped storage hydro plants appear to be an
important part of our goal to use renewable energy. But the present
proposal presents a very bad set of facts upon which to proceed.</pre>The above text is a conversion and thus may not be formatted correctly. To read the file in it's original form

NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY PERMIT APPLICATION ACCEPTED FOR FILING AND
SOLICITING COMMENTS, MOTIONS TO INTERVENE, AND COMPETING APPLICATIONS

(February 11, 2020)

On November 19, 2020, Premium Energy Holdings, LLC, filed an application
for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Ashokan Pumped
Storage Project to be located 14 miles west of the City of Kingston in
Ulster County, New York. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if
issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license
application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not
authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or
otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners’
express permission.

The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) a new
2,618-foot-long, 212-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 1 (Stony Clove Reservoir) with a surface
area of 245 acres and a storage capacity 22,496 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,500 feet above mean sea level (msl); (2) a new
2,736-foot-long, 232-foot-high roller-compacted concrete dam for the
upper reservoir for alternative 2 (Woodland Reservoir) with a surface
area of 313 acres and a storage capacity 26,231 acre-feet at a surface
elevation of 1,210 feet msl; (3) a new 2,527-foot-long, 304-foot-high
roller-compacted concrete dam for the upper reservoir for alternative 3
(Wittenberg Reservoir) with a surface area of 226 acres and a storage
capacity 25,558 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 1,180 feet msl; (4)
the existing Ashokan Reservoir for the lower reservoir with a surface
area of 8,300 acres and a storage capacity of 382,358 acre-feet at a
surface elevation of 585 feet msl; (5) new 13.99-mile-long tunnels,
shafts, and penstocks for alternative 1 connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs; (6) new 11.58-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for
alternative 2 connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (7) new
3.81-mile-long tunnels, shafts, and penstocks for alternative 3
connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (8) a new 500-foot-long,
125-foot-wide, 150-foot-high underground reinforced-concrete powerhouse
containing five turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of
800 megawatts; (9) a 17.3-mile-long, 230-kilovolt new transmission line
for alternatives 1 and 2 from the proposed Ashokan switchyard to the
existing Hurley avenue substation; (10) a 12.9-mile-long, 230-kilovolt
new transmission line for alternative 3 from the proposed Ashokan
switchyard to the existing Hurley avenue substation; and (11)
appurtenant facilities. The proposed project would have a maximum annual
generation of 2,700 gigawatt-hours.
