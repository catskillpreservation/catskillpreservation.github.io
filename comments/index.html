I am vehemently opposed to the project Premium Energy wishes to undertake in the towns of Shandaken and Olive. 

While I understand that energy storage is a critical issue for our region, the Catskills are not the proper location for such a project, and I question the appropriateness of this particular technology. According to my research, the Department of Energy stated in 2013, in a study covering pumped storage technology, that “no energy future was found to bring quantifiable revenues sufficient to cover estimated costs of plant construction.”

My understanding of the technology is that the upper reservoir would be subject to frequent water level changes, a disaster for the rainbow trout fishery that preserves wildlife and forms an important part of the local tourist economy.

This environmentally sensitive area would be adversely impacted by the flooding of valleys. Please do not allow this project to go forward.

Docket No. P-15056 -000  Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

The proposed project by Premium Energy, a California Co, to use the pristine land which is part of the Catskill Forest Preserve and the Ashokan reservoir that is highly protected as part of NYC’s drinking water is nothing but greedy and preposterous. We have owned our second home in Woodland Valley Phoenicia NY, one of the areas directly affected by this proposal for over 30 years. We raised our children and grandchildren to love, respect and always protect the natural wildlife and its abundant nature, as well as the wild streams that flow into the Ashokan and NYC’s drinking water. The proposal infringes on lands that are deemed to be “forever kept as wild forest land” and part of that land also includes the Woodland Valley Campground, est. in the 1930’s one of the oldest in NY and a major tourist attraction. If allowed to go forward the project will also negatively impact tourism which generates significant revenue for the local economy.  There are so many reasons why we passionately object to this irrational project. A project that was submitted to FERC as a “closed loop” project which from what we have learned appears to be quite the contrary.  Please do everything in your power to decline this project as it will ultimately desecrate one of the Catskills most scenic tourist areas with tremendous dams, transmission lines, turbines and tunnels, to possibly store enough energy to supply a small number of homes in the event current grid is overtaxed. The massive costs of this project coupled with the destruction to the ecosystem, drinking water, businesses, people’s lives, livelihoods and wellbeing, is not quantifiable nor well thought out. 
While renewal energy may be important in today’s world surely Premium Energy of Ca could seek out more suitable sites across the country that are barren or rural where a project of this nature would not have a detrimental effect on vital trout waters, an existing community, or clean drinking water.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Mary Huhn under P-15056.

I am a resident of West Shokan, a hamlet in the town of Olive, New York. 

West Shokan, as well as the very road I live on, Moonhaw Road, is one of the towns being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a 300-foot dam, giant reservoir, turbine, and 50-foot tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. There will also be unsightly transmission towers up and down many roads, the mountain and valleys, and along the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies drinking water 40% of water to New York City. A power plant would be built right next to the Ashokan reservoir. 
 
I reject this proposal, object to this proposal and downright am horrified by this proposal, which would negatively impact the environment, destroy communities, upend the homes of many wild creatures great and small. The construction would permanently damage the rivers and streams, and the power plant would disrupt the flow to and increase the turbidity of the Ashokan Reservoir, destroy mountains, as well as the quiet beauty of the Catskills, where people have been coming for centuries for respite. I request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. Whoever is reading this, please do everything you and your FERC colleagues can do to stop this proposal from going one step further.

Re:  Premiere Energy&#39;s proposition inside the Catskill Park, NY


Dear Secretary Bose:

    I am absolutely shocked that there is even a proposal for an energy project to be constructed inside the Catskill Park in Ulster County NY.  The land proposed for this project is within the “forever wild” forest lands created by New York State in 1885.  According to the NYS constitution  this land can not “be leased, sold, or exchanged, or taken by any corporation public or private.”  Any change to this must be made through constitutional amendment.  This proposal should not even be considered.

Also this project will impact the NYC watershed.  The city receives 40% of its water from the watershed with one of its most important reservoir just miles from the proposed project.  When you live in the watershed putting in a septic system is highly regulated by NYC DEP.  How can something this big and disruptive be considered under these circumstances?

This area of western Ulster County is highly dependent on tourism.  People come here for the pristine beauty of the Catskills as well as to fish in the premiere trout fishing stream, the Esopus.  If this project were to move forward the rapid water fluctuations that would occur would destroy the habitat and breeding grounds of trout.  This project would be a blight on that pristine beauty.

While the town of Olive, where this proposed project would be primarily located, is currently trying to come up with more environmentally friendly ways of supplying energy for our town this proposal is not.  The claim that this is a closed loop project is false.  The plan to have “add on” projects means it is not a closed loop therefore far more detrimental to our environment, in our town, our home.  I can  not believe that this is a project that the Department of Energy would approve as being in line with caring for the environment.

We moved here 40 years ago to live in the mountains and in the Catskill Park.  We do not want to see the beauty of our town, our home destroyed by a company trying to sneak its way into our county.   I hope that you will consider that our current administration ran on caring for the environment and that you will see that this project would jeopardize the forever wild environment of the Catskill Park in Ulster County, town of Olive NY.

I am writing to protest the proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant that would do irreparable damage to the Catskill Forest Preserve and surrounding areas. I am extremely concerned about the impact that this proposal would have on these highly preserved forests, the wildlife and ecosystems therein. Green energy is important and infrastructure always involves trade-offs between individual and public interests, but this proposal does not seem to offer the kind of innovation that would best serve the public in the long term. FERC should deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit, and consider other locations. This proposal is likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams and cause
increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for
nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to stop this from moving forward. Thank you.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Richard Lipfert under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/2/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Richard Lipfert, West Shokan, NY.
To Whom It May Concern,
I’m vehemently opposed to project P-15056-000 for the following reasons,
1. The desecration of the natural habitat and wildlife in the path of the proposed reservoir and power lines.
2. The possibility of water wells that can be effected.
3. The effects that this project on the Ashokan Reservoir will have on New York City’s main clean water supply.
4. Damage and changes of town roads that will effect travel due to heavy construction vehicles while construction could last anywhere from 7 to 10 years.
5. This project will stifle tourism and local businesses while removing properties from the current tax base.
6. My wife and I built our home 52 years ago and we raised our children here while tending to the acreage raising farm animals and growing vegetables and being what we considered good stewards of the land. Now in our so called “Golden years” we find ourselves in the position that our home will be uninhabitable due to the proposed 2 power lines/ towers going directly over the rooftop of our house. At the age of 78 we will be uprooted and forced to start a new life God knows where. I would not wish this on anyone! 
Please consider these and many other negative aspects that this project will have on our protected lands.

I am a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County.  I have been a part of the Chichester community all my 78 years; my mother and grandmother have been a part of the community their lives.  Although they are both gone now, my grandmother was one of the first up here and my son and grandchildren are also a part of the community. I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I support our nation’s transition to renewable energy, I believe the Catskills region is not the right location for such a project with significant impacts to state preserved forest land, streams, species, and the New York City water supply. Much of the harm is unlawful and in violation of the New York State Constitution. Further, Premium Energy does not provide the kind of innovation sought by the Department of Energy as its proposal is deficient and misleading. Premium Energy’s claim that it will build a closed loop-system is false.  Closer study indicates their proposal is actually an open loop system, an add-on project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source.  As you know, the environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 

The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve (established 1885). This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. Any changes in the management of State Forest Preserves have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum. Otherwise, it is unlawful and unconstitutional.  Consider also the fact that, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According to the US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report, areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.

I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy’s proposal; and DoE’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

I am strongly opposed to the Proposed Pump Storage Hydroelectric Plant in the Catskill Mountains.
My family and I have escaped to the Catskills from NYC and NJ for the past 80 years. The area has been mostly untouched by any major development for most of that time period.
It is still a beautiful area where nature still thrives now as it has for centuries.  This plant would bring environmental devastation.

I currently own a home on the Esopus Creek in Phoenicia.
I understand renewable energy is important but the plan is not good for the Catskills, an area that must be left alone for the reasons I will share below:

According to Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private&#34;.  This proposal violates Article XIV.

The impact on stream ecology from the pumped water would wreak havoc on valuable trout breeding in addition to properties like mine that are on the Esopus Creek.

This project would also pose risks to the NYC water supply which cost billions of dollars of investment; $1.7 billion since the 1990s alone.

This project would also have a major impact on the Catskills tourism economy. Tourism is integral to the NYS economy.  Tourism generated 17% of employment in the Catskills in 2019. It is a $1.6 billion industry in the region, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Ulster County represents 43% of that market.  And second homes generate $360 million in economic activity of which none want their land taken away due to &#34;eminent domain&#34;. 

Thank you for letting me voice my opinion.

Docket number P-15056-000

Dear Ms. Bose,

I am writing in response to the deeply flawed proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York&#39;s Catskill Mountains. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC&#39;s drinking water.

While there&#39;s no doubt that pumped storage and new hydroelectric projects will play a key role in our country&#39;s transition to renewable energy, the pristinely protected forests, streams, and wildlife of Catskill Forest Preserve must not be sacrificed in the process. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, it is clearly guaranteed that these lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; The Preserve currently contains 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat (very rare in our increasingly fragmented environment), and the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide, according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. It would be a true crime to destroy this sacred and wonderfully preserved land, and would set a doomed precedent for protected lands across the country.

Even once construction is complete, there would be further environmental devastation due to the interconnectedness of the Ashokan watershed and its tributaries. Pumped storage is notorious for wreaking havoc on nearby stream ecology and on both aquatic and land habitats, because within a pumped storage system, the upper reservoir is subject to rapid fluctuations as the water is pumped up and down. In addition to affecting wildlife, this can alter the sediment regime in connected tributaries, which has a cascading effect. The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would ultimately affect the sediment regime in the Esopus Creek, which is one of the Catskills&#39; most vital trout breeding waters, and one of the key creeks feeding into the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC&#39;s water supply, serving 1 billion gallons of water a day to 9.5 million people. Plus, Premium Energy&#39;s proposal is not a closed-loop system as they claim-it is in fact an &#34;add-on,&#34; and the water fluctuations would no doubt increase turbidity within the Ashokan and its watershed. Taking all this into account, it would be reckless to allow a project to proceed that would threaten such a valuable asset as the Ashokan Reservoir, which is the largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, and represents over $1.7 billion of investments since the 1990s alone.

In addition to its negative effects on the environment and water supply, Premium Energy&#39;s proposal would be deeply damaging to local communities. Any conceivable upper reservoir site in the Catskill Forest Preserve would require the seizing of homes and private property via eminent domain-a process that already displaced thousands when the Ashokan was constructed 100 years ago. Residents displaced by the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would likely have a hard time securing new housing, as there is currently a housing shortage in Ulster County, and for homes that are available, prices are through the roof. Beyond the problem of community displacement, there is also the proposed project&#39;s effect on the Catskills&#39; growing tourism economy, which generated 17% of employment in the Catskill region in 2019, and is a $1.6 billion industry, supporting roughly 20,000 jobs. Premium Energy&#39;s project would limit access to hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation in the Catskills, decrease the area&#39;s natural beauty, cut off access to skiing and concerts at Hunter Mountain, Hunter, and Tannersville, and otherwise dampen tourism in the region, negatively affecting businesses in Ulster County and beyond.

As a last point to make in opposition to Premium Energy&#39;s Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, it must be pointed out that their proposal does not even represent the kind of innovation that the Department of Energy wants to see. Closed-loop pumped storage projects have smaller environmental impacts than those that make use of existing watersheds, and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. This is why Premium is claiming this project to be &#34;closed-loop&#34; rather than being honest about what their project actually is: an &#34;add-on,&#34; using an existing body of water as a lower reservoir. This kind of project carries with it significantly higher risks, even when the lower reservoir is not a vital source of drinking water for our nation&#39;s largest city. How can we trust a company that would lie in their proposal simply for the advantage of being fast-tracked for approval?

Our country&#39;s transition to renewable, green-energy sources must not come at the cost of environmental and community devastation. I hope Premium Energy will be able to find a suitable alternative location for a pumped storage project-one where the construction and operation will not destroy protected wilderness, displace vulnerable communities, and threaten incredibly important natural resources.

Please do the right thing and deny Premium Energy&#39;s proposal for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056.

Please do everything in your power to STOP Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.

It is illogical, not to mention incredibly stupid, to use more energy to pump water up to a storage area than one would get when it is released downhill. 

It is immoral to destroy the homes and lives of countless people, fauna and flora in order to create this storage area. It is immoral to violate the Catskill Forest preserve. It is incredibly stupid to build a three-hundred-foot dam in an era when dams are known to cause more harm than good. It is incredibly stupid not to anticipate a catastrophe from a burst dam, which would wreak havoc for years.

Both my residence and work (Menla Mountain Retreat) are located in Woodland Valley, New York. It would be  devastating to the protected forests, streams, wildlife, and the environment of the Catskill Forest Preserve if a dam was placed in this area.

The Catskill Forest Preserve has been protected by the NY State Constitution since 1885. Designated Status One Land, the Dept. of Energy respects this land as requiring strict protection against development.

The Ashokan Pump Storage Project would be in violation of the NY State Constitution, increasing turbidity in NYC drinking water (approximately 1 billion gallons for 9.5 million persons daily), scarring the Ashokan Watershed area, disrupting our tourism economy, and displacing area residents for a second time.

Article XIV of the NYS Constitution specifically states that these forested lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild...&#34;. And that they &#34;shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; 

As a pristine 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat, the forested area ranks among the top 1% of such habitats region-wide. The Catskill&#39;s own State Forest Preserve is considered Status One Land under the USGS &#34;Gap Analysis Program&#34;.

The Catskill Forest Preserve has been protected by the NY State Constitution since 1885. Designated Status One Land, the Dept. of Energy respects this land as requiring strict protection against development. I was born and raised in the area, and it is a truly special and unique part of the country that holds great value in so many ways.

The Ashokan Pump Storage Project would be in violation of the NY State Constitution, increasing turbidity in NYC drinking water (approximately 1 billion gallons for 9.5 million persons daily), scarring the Ashokan Watershed area, disrupting our tourism economy, and displacing area residents for a second time.

Article XIV of the NYS Constitution specifically states that these forested lands &#34;shall be forever kept as wild...&#34;. And that they &#34;shall not be leased, sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; 

As a pristine 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat, the forested area ranks among the top 1% of such habitats region-wide. The Catskill&#39;s own State Forest Preserve is considered Status One Land under the USGS &#34;Gap Analysis Program&#34;.  Areas considered Status One, with formal protections under the Dept. of Energy &#34;Hydropower Vision&#34; are specified as to be avoided for development.

To Whom It May Concern, 

I wish to voice my opposition to the proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings to build a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. Although I agree that sustainable and renewable energy is important, I strongly oppose Project P-15056-000. I believe the Catskill Mountains is not the right place for such an intrusive project, and would have a long-term devastating impact on the environment and community. The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams that are part of a Status 1 State Forest Preserve, and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. 

In addition, a long-term project of this kind, with a constant flow of heavy construction vehicles and road restrictions, would deter much relied upon tourism, and cause road congestion for many years for the community.

And lastly, a project of this kind with a massive power line path would cause many homes of established residents to be vacated and possibly leveled. This displacement of families, including my own, who have built and maintained their homesteads over many years, respecting and preserving the surrounding environment, would be absolutely devastating.

In conclusion, I believe the project would be better suited in a location that:

1. Is not a Status 1 State Forest Preserve.
2. An area where an “Add On” reservoir does not pose a serious risk to one of the largest reservoirs providing pristine drinking water to NYC residents, and local wells.
3. Is situated in an area that is not populated by a community of long-term, established residents, who rely on a healthy tourism economy.

West Shokan, NY 12494</pre><hr><b>Comments of Miles T Naughton under P-15056. Submission Date: 4/2/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Miles T Naughton, West Shokan, NY.
To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a pumped storage plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 

First of all, I do understand the need for energy storage and that pumped storage can be the preferred option if a proper location is found. A location using a closed-loop system where it would have minimal impact on the environment, wildlife, and communities involved. 

Premium Energy’s open-loop proposal seems to have overlooked these criteria. The three sites they proposed for this project are located in an area that is a delicate balance of highly preserved lands, rich wildlife, and diverse watershed communities.

This project would have severe impacts on highly preserved forests and lands. The Catskill Forest Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index.

As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private. 

The proposed project would wreak havoc on stream ecology and vital trout habitat. Maltby Hollow Brook has some of the highest quality water in the region coming directly form the highest peaks in the Catskills. This area provides suburb spawning grounds for brown, rainbow, and brook trout. The proposed dam would cause rapid fluctuations of water flow which is needed to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Furthermore, a slow-moving or still reservoir would heat up, resulting in abnormal temperature fluctuations which can lead to algal blooms and decreased oxygen levels. Today it is estimated that less than 9% of the areas that historically supported brook trout are intact. 
Native brook trout, which require the highest quality waters, currently thrive in Maltby Hollow brook. Altering the stream ecology here would make this area forever uninhabitable to brook, and all other species of trout. 

New York City has one of the largest and complex unfiltered water systems in the country. Ashokan Reservoir provides 40% of this water. The streams affected in this proposal all provide class A water from the higher peaks and forests down to the Ashokan Reservoir. Diverting water through an open pumped storage system would upset the natural filtration of water coming into the reservoir and likely increase turbidity which would have a negative impact on water quality. Currently, NYC meets its water needs through watershed management and water quality preservation. If NYC were to lose its ability to use unfiltered water due to loss of water quality, the estimated cost to operate a filtration system could exceed one million dollars per day. 

Furthermore, this proposal would have an extreme impact on the watershed communities affected. All three sites would put sections of each community underwater. This includes infrastructure, roads, historic sites, and some of the most pristine homes, estates, and private lands in the region. The remaining sections of each community would be transitioned into a vast flood zone. At time when global warming is making the weather more extreme and the streams flashier and more erratic. 

I think it would be in Prime Energy’s best interest to first do some basic research on a proposed site instead of hastily picking spots from a topo map from thousands of miles away. Prime Energy’s proposal is ill-conceived and unacceptable, and it is my hope that FERC will reject this proposal. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to voice my objection to Project P-15056-000.

I have been a resident of the town of Olive for 52 years and I am very concerned about the negative effects that this project will have on such a pristine area which is currently protected by the New York State constitution.

These are my concerns:

1. The negative effects on the New York City water supply and local wells.
2. The destruction of wildlife habitat and forestry.
3. The decline of tourism in this area that would directly affect our local community and businesses.
4. Many residents will be displaced including my family due to the proposed power lines that will directly run over my property and home.

In closing, I want to emphasize my commitment to preserve the natural environment of the Catskills Park and respectfully ask you to deny any permit applications related to this project.

I grew up in West Shokan, where my maternal ancestors lived since 1792. I currently have a house in Olivebridge. The Ashokan Reservoir is beautiful; it is also the evocative watery grave of Old West Shokan and nine other hamlets in the Towns of Olive and Hurley. Recently nearby “new” Boiceville was carelessly  partially erased due to flood mitigation. The latest lunacy, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, is not needed and is a threat to the public. It would be unsightly. This project is far too much of a risk to a precious resource: drinking water. It was conceived of by secretive opportunistic entrepreneurs from distant states with no appreciation of nor respect for the culture, historic, and ecological significance of the area. West Shokan and the Ashokan are sensitive environmentally. The Catskills have been abused enough; please do not allow it to happen again.</pre><hr><b>Comment of Alex Marshall in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 4/2/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alex Marshall, Olivebridge, NY.
It’s an admirable idea to improve sustainable energy   storage and reduce cost. The proposal in question raises several issues — cost,immediate Impact on local communities and long-term amenity.

No cost estimate is included in the proposal, but on the face of it, the amount and nature  of construction must be considerable.

Extensive construction in a remote area — much of it designated wilderness — will cause considerable upheaval to local residents, and reduce attraction to tourists.  The Catskill Park is unique in its unspoiled nature and its accessibility to East Coast population centers.

The final form of the project is unclear, but at the very least there will be new building and transmission lines. The impact on the unique character of the Catskill Park will be permanent. 

Finally, with the best will in the world, there will be some impact on the Ashokan Reservoir, the major supply of water to New York City.   

For these reasons I oppose the proposal

There is no doubt the kind of pumped storage energy systems like that proposed in this application have value in advancing the expansion of renewable energy in the region. 

The issue is that this is not the place in which to site a project that has legal and environmental implications that span local, county, city, and state governments. The most glaring oversight is that this project inevitably disturbs over 100 years of sediment since the Ashokan reservoir was built in 1915.

The construction is one phase of development that impacts water quality in the reservoir. The continuous daily pumping and discharge of water between any new upper holding reservoir and the Ashokan assures that turbidity is permanently elevated in one of the most sensitive trout fisheries in the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Not least of all, affecting drinking water quality for the 9 million customers in New York City, as 40% of its unfiltered drinking water passes through the Ashokan reservoir. The City of New York does not have the capital to construct a filtration system, having for decades relied on the undisturbed nature of the Catskills region to provide that water. It is the largest unfiltered water system in the world.

I write my comment as a farmer and agritourism operator just west of the proposed site. In recent years major bridge construction along the Route 28 corridor served as an impediment to tourists accessing the interior of the Catskill mountains. When guests visit from afar, the last thing they want is to sit in traffic or take long detours to reach their destination for a weekend or holiday trip. The construction of a new dam and proposed infrastructure inevitably places a burden on the local tourist economies. The damage to local tourist economies isn&#39;t off-set in the long-run by the temporary construction jobs that are created.

Lastly, this is not a closed-loop project. It&#39;s an add-on project. The Esopus River flows into and out of the Ashokan Reservoir before meeting the Hudson River. This project directly interacts with a unfiltered public water source. As it is within a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are designated Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” The Dept of Energy&#39;s own materials on hydropower indicate that development of Status 1 or 2 lands should be avoided.

Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by
constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state
legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum.

This is the right project in the wrong place. It&#39;s not a simple not-in-my-backyard situation, it seems as if this permit proposal was submitted without any contextual understanding of what water source Premium Energy Holdings wants to use or the land that will be required to implement the project.

Please deny the application for this project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Rebecca Van Kollenburg under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Rebecca Van Kollenburg, PURLING, NY.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I am part of the Catskills community and would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook is where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time, 

Sincerely,
Kristen Edwards</pre><hr><b>Comment of Jasmine Jordaan in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 4/1/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Jasmine Jordaan, West Shokan, NY.
Dear FERC Representative,

 

I am writing in my capacity as a concerned property owner in one of the potential dam sites as well as an attorney who has worked for several years for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection working on protecting the watershed through their land acquisition program. The first point that jumps out at me is the huge turbidity threat that this project poses to the New York City drinking water which Services more than 9 million people. Although I see the benefits of hydroelectric power, it is not feasible in our location due to the interests of New York City and the implications of this project interfering with the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Grant of consent for the NYC Filtration Avoidance Program. So not only is there a City issue here there is an interference with a federal agency&#39;s consent. Granting this permit will result in years of litigation with New York City as well as several federal agencies and state agencies. Aside from this monumental hurdle to this project there is several other huge implications such as the fact that the Catskill Park is one of the only national areas with more than 700,000 acres in continuous protection by the state as well as the city (due to the land acquisition program). This protection has been in effect for over 100 years and has resulted in animal and stream habitats that would be directly affected by this project. This project appears to not only create a huge dam but also to require high voltage electric lines to be put in place through protected lands. This is yet one more issue with this project. Also, in reviewing the application there are several misrepresentations a glaring one being that the company is describing this as a closed loop system which is not correct. Ashokan reservoir has the Esopus running into it which clearly is not a closed loop system. From participating in several meetings concerning this project it appears that there is tremendous opposition to this and I hope that you take all these comments into consideration and not Grant this initial permit which will save many hours of taxpayers money since this will trigger tremendous amount of litigation. I&#39;m surprised that this California company has made an application which takes on the entire New York City water supply system.

Hello,

I am very concerned about this proposed hydro-electric power plant from Premium Energy LLC and I vehemently oppose it. By allowing this to be built you will destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The project would increase turbidity and pollution in the protected Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s drinking water. Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that has ALREADY displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.

I am writing today, as a concerned Catskills property owner, about a CA company, Premium Energy Holdings recent proposal to FREC, regarding creating a pumped storage hydroelectric plant, using the Ashokan Reservoir.

Despite the fact that I strongly support clean/ renewable energy initiatives, I oppose this move for 2 primary reasons:

(1)  This project will significantly impact homes and communities, local infrastructure, water quality, and natural habitats on public and private lands.  Recreational use of the land, tourism and local economies would also be impacted. 

(2) This plan was submitted without input from NYCDEP, NYS’s Dept of Environmental Conservation, or from local leaders or stakeholders.

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats. Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time,

Dear FERC Representative,

 

I am writing in my capacity as a concerned property owner in one of the potential dam sites as well as an attorney who has worked for several years for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection working on protecting the watershed through their land acquisition program. The first point that jumps out at me is the huge turbidity threat that this project poses to the New York City drinking water which Services more than 9 million people. Although I see the benefits of hydroelectric power, it is not feasible in our location due to the interests of New York City and the implications of this project interfering with the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Grant of consent for the NYC Filtration Avoidance Program. So not only is there a City issue here there is an interference with a federal agency&#39;s consent. Granting this permit will result in years of litigation with New York City as well as several federal agencies and state agencies. Aside from this monumental hurdle to this project there is several other huge implications such as the fact that the Catskill Park is one of the only national areas with more than 700,000 acres in continuous protection by the state as well as the city (due to the land acquisition program). This protection has been in effect for over 100 years and has resulted in animal and stream habitats that would be directly affected by this project. This project appears to not only create a huge dam but also to require high voltage electric lines to be put in place through protected lands. This is yet one more issue with this project. Also, in reviewing the application there are several misrepresentations a glaring one being that the company is describing this as a closed loop system which is not correct. Ashokan reservoir has the Esopus running into it which clearly is not a closed loop system. From participating in several meetings concerning this project it appears that there is tremendous opposition to this and I hope that you take all these comments into consideration and not Grant this initial permit which will save many hours of taxpayers money since this will trigger tremendous amount of litigation. I&#39;m surprised that this California company has made an application which takes on the entire New York City water supply system. Thank you for your attention to this, Jasmine Jordaan</pre><hr><b>Comments of Parihan Rahman-Porras under P-15056.

Hello,

I am very concerned about this proposed hydro-electric power plant from Premium Energy LLC and I vehemently oppose it. By allowing this to be built you will destroy highly preserved forests, wildlife, and stream ecology. The project would increase turbidity and pollution in the protected Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies 40% of NYC’s drinking water. Private property would be taken by eminent domain—a process that has ALREADY displaced thousands in this area when the Ashokan Reservoir was built.
 The Catskills are a State Preserve protected by the NY State Constitution and this proposal is in violation of it. We will take this to the rest of the NYS government  to voice our concern as this proposed plant is illegal and should not move forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Tricia Bard under P-15056.

I am writing today, as a concerned Catskills property owner, about a CA company, Premium Energy Holdings recent proposal to FREC, regarding creating a pumped storage hydroelectric plant, using the Ashokan Reservoir.

Despite the fact that I strongly support clean/ renewable energy initiatives, I oppose this move for 2 primary reasons:

(1)  This project will significantly impact homes and communities, local infrastructure, water quality, and natural habitats on public and private lands.  Recreational use of the land, tourism and local economies would also be impacted. 

(2) This plan was submitted without input from NYCDEP, NYS’s Dept of Environmental Conservation, or from local leaders or stakeholders.  

I firmly believe that this project should not move forward.

To Whom it may Concern,
​FERC Project No. 15056-000, Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, submitted by Premium Energy Holdings LLC, Walnut, CA goes directly against New York State Constitution. “ The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold, or taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed.” – Article XIV, New York State Constitution.  
Reasons to say “NO” to the proposed dam.
- The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index
- As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
- Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the NYC water supply
- The largest unfiltered water supply in the nation, built at the cost of displacing 25 communities
The American people have been stepped on too many times, please do not hurt our mountains any further.

This is a very bad idea. Please ensure that New York City is involved in responding to this terrible proposal. In addition to the severe environmental impact to a beautiful wild state-protected area, the ultimate consequences to the water system of the greater New York City area would be profound. It was also very sneaky of the company to make this proposal without informing highly interested parties such as New York City Department of Environmental Protection, not to mention state and local government entities.

This proposal is shocking, outrageous and totally ill considered! And it shows NO knowledge, respect or concern for the Catskills and its people—and NYC. Clean, fresh water is the Catskills greatest resource. Which is why we have fought so hard against fracking—and won! Our tourist industry is dependent on that water, for fishing and so many other recreational activities. In addition, the Catskills has many family farms, and fresh water is crucial for livestock, cows, sheep and increasingly alpacas and horses, and of course, it is also necessary for agriculture. The Catskills are America’s first great wilderness, lost in the 19th century to other irresponsible uses, such as the destruction of the hemlock forests by the tanning industry. Due to protections, such as codifying the Catskill Park as Forever Wild in NYS law (and how does this irresponsible proposal get around THAT?), the Catskills and its waters, which were thoroughly polluted by past egregiousness, have revived. Our streams and rivers offer some of the best fly fishing, as the trout, along with many mountain critters, such as the white-tailed deer and black bear, have returned with our reforested slopes and clean water. Our waters also, and crucially,  supply drinking water to New York City, and the Ashokan Reservoir is the main reservoir whose sweet, clean waters flow to downstate. This project would put that water supply at risk!  And according to one article, the NYDEP, in addition to the Catskill towns concerned, was not even notified? And according to the same article, a Catskill town would be flooded for this? Absolutely not! That happened to too many villages to build the reservoirs. Catskillers, folks native to this area and the many downstaters now increasingly living here—and lots more have moved here due to the pandemic—simply won’t stand for this. This project would alter the hydrology of our local waters, the Esopus Creek, for starters, affect the quality of our water for recreational and drinking uses, both on a personal and commercial level, and also—and just as important—impact our wildlife, which has struggled and finally succeeded in making a comeback here. The Catskills, as anyone making such an irresponsible proposal, soon learns, are home to many committed, passionate and EFFECTIVE grass-roots environmental groups and individuals who will resist any such efforts that would result in compromising in any way our precious natural resources. My vote is a resounding NO!</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header3><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse3 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse3>

888 First St. NE, Room 1A 
Washington, D.C. 20426. 

Docket number P-15056-000 


Ms. Bose,

I’m writing regarding Premium Energy Holdings of California’s proposal to build a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains, including a 300-acre reservoir at one of three sites and a tunnel to bring the water to the east shore of the upper basin of the Ashokan Reservoir. The three sites are Chichester, Woodland Valley, and the Moonhaw valley in the hamlet of West Shokan, Town of Olive. My comments focus on Moonhaw and West Shokan.  

This construction would impact state land, and as a designated Wilderness Area of the New York State Forest Preserve, the upper reaches of Moonhaw valley are protected from development, per Article XIV of the New York State Constitution.

Also building in these areas would have a devastating impact on tourism in the Catskills, which is integral to the NYS economy, generating 17% of employment in the region in 2019 and providing about 20K jobs, with Ulster County representing 43% of that market and second homes in the area creating $360 million in economic activity.  

Moonhaw is also a community with many homes, valued up to $2.5 million each. This thriving community would be decimated by this construction.

I strongly urge you to recommend that Premium Energy’s proposal be rejected.

Sincerely,

The company seeking the permit have shown zero concern for the people, community and land that the project would impact.  Their assurances that the project would only be undertaken with approval of the community are entirely hollow, evidenced by the complete lack of due diligence done before dropping proposed reservoir sites onto a map.  The applicant clearly did not make even the most basic effort to understand the areas they propose to investigate.  Had they done so, they would have easily realized that their proposal would encroach on legally protected forever wild lands and displace entire hamlets and residential areas.

Rather than requiring the community to go on high alert and rush to defend itself against a poorly though out proposal, perhaps the better path would be for the applicant to construct a proposal that is not completely devoid of basic knowledge, insight on or concern for the local region.  Then having demonstrated that basic level of due diligence, the community could with sufficient time and information, thoughtfully consider and respond taking all the pros and cons into account.

Until then, I ask the FERC to say NO and our elected officials and community to vigorously defend against this proposal.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Melissa A. Rabuffo under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/31/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Melissa A. Rabuffo, Chichester, NY.
Project Docket:  P-15056
Melissa Rabuffo, Chichester, N.Y.

As a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County, I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings.  I agree and support the national initiative to increase and transition to renewable energy. It is a necessary goal and objective nationally, as well as worldwide.  I am in support of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reducing the effects of climate change, but this proposal is not the right plan and it does not reflect the right kind of initiative which the Department of Energy should approve.   

This portion of the Catskill region, and all three proposed sites, are not the right location for this project due to its incredible impact to state preserved forest land, streams, and the New York City Water Supply.  It is also unlawful and in direct violation of the New York State Constitution and puts in question using public land for private gain. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Any changes to the land management in the State Forest Preserve must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, and then submitted to the public in a referendum.  For that reason alone, this proposal misunderstands or does not take into account the logistical issues of such a project. 

The proposal itself is full of inaccuracies and lack of diligence which makes one suspect the Premium’s ability and basic understanding of scope to engage in this endeavor. The proposal claims that it is a closed-loop system, yet it is connecting to the Ashokan Reservoir. The Esopus Creek and other streams connect to the Ashokan Reservoir so in effect this is an open-loop system.  The Department of Energy encourages the use of close-loop systems, but not open-loop systems.  In addition, Premium Energy did not inform the various stakeholders and communities that could be impacted for comment. 

As the largest national preserve closest to New York City, as well as supplying 40% of its drinking water, the amount of protest and concern would be overwhelming. There are also legitimate concerns about how this open-loop system would impact turbidity and water quality for over 9 million residents in New York City.  

Environmentally, the Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County and is 700,00 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasing fragmented environment.  The proposed reservoir falls within the Audubon Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area.  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program”.  According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

As it stands, there is strong opposition from all represented parties locally including townships, conservation groups, business owners, as well as an involved and invested residents and visitors.   Phoenicia, which is the largest town in this area,  is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Catskill Mountains.  Phoenicia is rated as one of the Top Ten Small Towns in America (Budget Travel Magazine). It also has been ranked as the #1 destination outside of NYC.  The amount of people who are moving to or trying to live her full time in the last year is astounding.  The local and regional resistance to taking land from existing home owners or potential homeowners would be a political nightmare and a public relations disaster for Premium.  

Historically, this is an area which was flooded 100 years ago to create the Ashokan Reservoir and displaced 22 townships.  There continues to be historical trauma and outrage in this area which is significant to this day.  Our area is filled with brown signs along our roads declaring Former Site of West Shokan, Olivebridge, Ashokan, and Shokan, as well as towns which no longer exist such as Brown’s Station.   The residents and those who love the Catskills would vehemently oppose this happening again in this area. 

Due to the Catskill Forest being a protected preserve protected by the NY State Constitution, the misleading and inaccuracies of the Premium Energy proposal, the direct threat to NY City drinking water and environmental impact, and strong public opposition, are all key reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 

I am part of the Catskills community that would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056:000. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 
First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

I live on Moonhaw Road, one of the locations under consideration. The end of our road, where one of the storage facilities is being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 

The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 
In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats.  Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 
I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points. 

Thank you for your time,

We are a tourist attraction, and this unsightly project would negatively impact tourism in our town. Also, years ago we did a large study on the local ecology in our valley, and our property and surrounding area are home to several endangered species of birds (including the eastern hellbender and the Bicknell&#39;s Thrush), a rare sanctuary to hundreds of species of lichen, in addition to providing habitats for rabbits, foxes, deer, turkeys, coyotes, fisher cats, bears, and even mountain lions, among other species.

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, likely to damage local lands, roads, and streams, disrupt the local ecosystem, and cause increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for nine million people in New York City. Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats.  Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land. 

I ask that you deny this permit based on these essential points.

Dear Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
I am part of the Catskills community that would like to bring awareness to a pending proposal from Premium Energy: FERC project and sub- docket number: P-15056. Premium Energy is has applied for a preliminary permit to conduct studies on building a pumped storage plant utilizing the Ashokan reservoir. This project raises environmental concerns and we ask that this permit be denied based on information in this letter along with additional information which is being provided from Interveners and concerned citizens. 

First, it is essential to note that Premium Energy is misrepresenting this project by describing it as a closed loop project. According to hydro power experts in the area, this is not a closed loop project. It is an add-on project which will have much more of a detrimental environmental impact than a closed loop project. This misinformation used to push the project forward is deeply troubling to the community and raises concern over Premium Energies practices. 

A site where the storage facilities are being proposed is designated Forever Wild. Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  

All the sites in this proposal are within the Catskills, which is designated as Status 1 land. According to the Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 
Yet, this is what is being proposed by Premium Energy. 
The Protected Three Birds Orchid currently at the end of Maltby Hollow Creek and both sides of the upper Dry Brook where one storage facility is being proposed. These sites are registered in the Biological and Conservation Database for North America. All proposed sites in this project are noted by the Audubon society as a “Catskills Peaks Important Bird Area.”

The sites in this project are foraging habitats for NY-threatened northern long-eared bat and habitat for NY-Species of Greatest Conservation Need, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush, as well as NY-Special Concern raptors Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. It is also habitat for NY-Special Concern eastern hognose snake and NY-Threatened timber rattlesnake. 

In addition, Maltby Hollow Creek, Wittenberg Brook and the Esopus are trout waters and trout spawning habitat. Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which can wreak havoc on aquatic and land habitats.  Sediment in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters. Valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

Our community understands the need for clean energy and for pumped storage. However, these proposed locations are in the habitat of threatened species. Forever Wild areas and  Status 1 protected land.

Basis for Intervening:
Theodore Gordon Flyfisher, Inc, (TGF) is a not-for-profit angling organization committed to stream and river protection and the preservation of wild trout populations in the Catskills.  If approved, the proposed project will impact the quality of the water of the Esopus and its tributaries.  TGF moves to be made an Intervenor in these proceedings to represent its members, who have a vital interest in the protection of these rivers and streams.  TGF’s members are avid anglers that live in the Northeast and frequently fish in the Esopus and its tributaries.

Since its founding in 1963, TGF’s singular mission has been to preserve the habitat of wild trout populations, including the native brook trout in New York State.  The locations of any of the three dams proposed for the project will eliminate or severely restrict the flow of water in a tributary to the Esopus river.  Each of those tributaries provide critical spawning habitat for wild and nativized trout, including native brook trout.  Reducing spawning habitat will impact the population of wild trout in the river system and degrade the quality of the river system that TGF members use for recreation.  

TGF members are intimately familiar with the condition of these streams.  Many of them have spent a lifetime fishing these waters. On behalf of its members, TGF successfully sued the City of New York under the Clean Water Act to require the City to monitor and reduce turbidity of water the city released into the Esopus.  See Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. City of New York, 451 F.3d 77, 62 ERC 1737 (2d Cir. 2006).  Through its continued efforts to advocate for the protection of the Esopus, TGF’s directors and members have gained a deep understanding of the river system and can provide a unique perspective to the proceedings.   

TGF works hard to keep its members informed of conservation issues that effect the cold-water fisheries around the Northeast, including the Esopus watershed.  For over twenty years TGF has kept its members informed about important conservation issues in the region through the publication of its newsletter, Gordon’s Quill https://www.tgf.org/publications.  The TGF board receives feedback from its members and remains informed of their concerns.  Granting this petition to have TGF added as a party to these proceedings will allow TGF to represent the interest of its members related to this project. 

Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion.</pre><hr><b>(doc-less) Motion to Intervene of Woodland Community Association under P-15056.</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Submission Description: (doc-less) Motion to Intervene of Woodland Community Association under P-15056-000.

Dear Secretary Bose,
Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Rules, Practices and Procedures (18 CFR Section 385.314) the Woodland Community Association, the only organization representing home and property owners in the hamlet of Woodland Valley in the Town of Shandaken, Ulster County New York, hereby petitions the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant it intervener status in the above proceeding.

Basis for Intervening: 
The Woodland Community Association represents the home and property owners of Woodland Valley who have an interest in the Preliminary Permit application submitted to the Commission by Premium Energy for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project (P-15056). The proposed reservoir in Woodland Valley would either flood, or cut off access to, almost all of 200&#43; homes in Woodland Valley. Accordingly, the Woodland Valley residents have a primary and vital interest in this matter. We seek to become a party to this proceeding to insure that the interests of the residents are properly represented. 

Neither disruption to the proceedings nor any additional burden to any party will result from the granting of this Motion. In light of the foregoing, the Woodland Community Association respectfully petitions for intervener status.

Proposed site is inappropriate for pumped storage and will not efficiently use funds to provide maximum peak storage capacity.

Pumped storage projects usually use ‘cleaned’ / lined reservoirs on vacant land, like Blenheim – Gilboa, to ensure water quality.  Proposed reservoirs would be created in heavily occupied areas including abandoned &amp; lost septic systems, congregate &amp; private dumps, lead &amp; asbestos in most buildings.  Areas are covered in dense forest.  Remediation necessary for removing and disposing of contamination would be very costly.

Pumped storage projects rely on NATRUAL elevation differences, low bermed reservoirs to minimize costs &amp; transport of massive quantities of concrete &amp; reinforcing for high dams with far less requirements for in depth foundations, as well as far less problems with silt, debris, &amp; and other contaminated construction run off. 

Bedrock depth varies up to and over 500 feet in place.  Soil column contains strata’s of artesian springs, voids, quick sands, clays, rock etc. This needs removal, shoring, dewatering to blast foundations into bedrock.  Anything less risks dams failure which would kill thousands living clustered along stream banks &amp; render the Ashokan Reservoir providing water for 10 million, contaminated, useless

Interrupting aquifers that travel along valley bottoms, wells for all buildings down stream are at risk, failure will require yet more property acquisition.

Construction of MASSIVE dams will require MASSIVE amounts of trucked in material over a SINGLE TWO LANE ROAD.  Such loading will beat the highways to rubble &amp; will probably wear out all but the 2 main highway bridges.  HUNDREDS of trucks a day will spew mammoth amounts of pollution to the many buildings close to the roads.  Vibrations will lead to damage to many.

Areas are fully occupied with homes lining roads.  Roads in subject areas are critical access roads to other areas with limited access. Electrical power to subject valleys is from one end only and this project would leave stranded all properties not flooded from both power and access requiring their acquisition also.

Proposed dams are inappropriate for pumped storage projects ESPECIALLY as part of a municipal water supply system for over 10 million people, as they will CERTIANLY lead to extensive construction contamination followed by even more contamination from reservoirs filled with remains of if not actual hundreds of thousands of trees, asphalt highways, drives etc.  Acquisition costs alone will exceed ½ billion dollars unless owners are paid LESS than what they’ll need to buy homes in the area, close to family, friends and jobs. Remediation of constructed environment will cost hundreds of millions including digging up dozens of acres of abandoned dumps along with the soil sewerage and garbage wastes percolated into.  Tens of millions will be needed for the removal of trees and other bio mass and stabilization of the bared forest floors to prevent their quick erosion from creating an ecological disaster.  The project will also need to reimburse NYS tens of millions for repeated road reconstruction and bridge replacements as it’s hundreds of trucks a day destroy them.  The project will need to reimburse tens of millions more to hundreds, thousands of property owners from vibration damage to homes often yards from roads, &amp; to businesses for loss of income from truck, fume, and dust choked roads and hundreds of millions for tourism businesses for permanent reduction of business.

Furthermore, the proposal to site the generation facility in massive caverns deep under ground with miles of associated access, air, and water tunnels up to 50 feet wide, through loose fills saturated with water to solid bedrock will create the most expensive generator building in the US.  As being located and connected to and BELOW the level of the Ashokan Reservoir any failure of dewatering pumps will risk the contamination of the reservoir with tons of lubricants &amp; chemicals needed to maintain generators &amp; building, along with leachate from plastics and chemicals embedded in the generator building itself.  

These issues, along with the work being performed in the most costly construction market in the US, subject to approval by NYS and NYC Building Codes as well as NYS and NYC DEP regulations and approval PLUS Federal Oversight to ensure water quality remains unaffected by the work or operations will be the most expensive hydro power project every attempted in the US and no doubt the most expensive pumped storage project in the world.

For the BILLIONS it would take to realize this projects full potential similar capacity of liquified compressed air off peak storage as is being installed on remote islands could be located nearest power hungry areas, thus saving on transmission system costs and transmission losses.

The application is a virtual cut and paste of prior applications down to facility size, power house location, and the most dubious and vague construction methodologies.

The applicant has also been reported to have made ignorant if not misleading statements, indicating the firm is working at the request of PSEG Long Island to provide peak power for LI.  All transmission lines feeding NYC &amp; LI are maxed out on peak days.  The very time the energy would be most needed, the facility would need to sit idle.  (Ashokan-Plant_Hudson-Valley-One.pdf (shandaken-ny.com))  The applicant also states that as engineer they have no interest in the project, despite 5 million dollar cost of report nearly DOUBLING yearly billing.

The above indicates an inability of applicant to perform to a minimum standard of veracity care and due diligence VITAL in the construction of SIGNIFICANT dams and infrastructure, inability of same to design facility to produce power at economical price to consumers, and inability to care for the water supply of over 10 million people, and should require the immediate rejection of this application.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Morgan Lyle under P-15056.

On behalf of Golden Woodlands, LLC, I urge FERC to decline Premium Energy Holding’s request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056. My family has been a landowner in Olivebridge, NY since 1950, and the third generation of our family currently lives on our property.  Golden Woodlands, LLC, the land holding entity for the family is adamantly opposed to the highly destructive proposal submitted to FERC by Premium Energy Holdings.  We will collaborate with others opposing this project until it is defeated, no matter how long it takes.  We have very deep roots in the community and will actively oppose this proposal which will drastically impact the area’s ecology, landscape, economy, and detrimentally impact the NYC water supply.

The Town of Olive is the wrong place for a project of this type.  The community, which still harbors some resentment from its relocation due to the construction of Ashokan Reservoir has contributed substantially to the public welfare of the State and region.  Bound by forever wild lands of NYS Department of Environmental Conservation in the Catskill Forest Preserve, and highly protected lands within the NYC Department of Environmental Protection Watershed, its resource base is already limited and cannot afford to be severed by an additional reservoir and lengthy transmission lands.  

A project of this type should only be located closer to a population center and existing transmission facilities, so as to more efficiently utilize the energy savings created.
It appears that the transmission lines for this proposal will cross property owned by Golden Woodlands.  We guarantee the applicant will have to use eminent domain to acquire any of our holdings and we will fight at each step of the process placing every legal obstacle in the way.  Several of our neighbors have all agreed to make a concerted effort to challenge any access to the property along the route shown on the preliminary map.

We will insist that the applicant submit a full environmental impact statement and analysis of alternatives sites considered.  It is also our understanding that the reservoir sites and transmission lines identified potentially impact species of special concern including both plants and animals and that the US Fish and Wildlife Service needs to thoroughly investigate all potential impacts in the entire watershed.  

The Ashokan Reservoir is a engineering achievement of extraordinary national historic and cultural value and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic sites and merits protection of its entire infrastructure including the quarries and roads which were used in its construction.  A detailed historical survey must be completed for planning to proceed.  

Finally, the economy of the southern Catskills will be drastically impacted by a project of this magnitude, and a comprehensive assessment of its economic impact is essential.  It is likely that the negative impact on the region’s value as a world class fishery, its historically notable landscapes painted by the Hudson River School of Painters, and written of by notable early conservationists like John Burroughs, the popular Catskill hiking trails in the area, and extraordinary opportunities on and off-road biking must be accounted for.  It seems likely that far more value will be lost than that created by the pump storage project.

Please stop this project and decline a preliminary permit now rather than create the long-term disruption and cost it will inevitable create with very uncertain outcome.  Simply this is the wrong place for this type of project.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header4><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse4 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse4>

FERC Docket # P-15056

I own a home on Stony Clove Lane in Chichester, NY.  I am writing in opposition to the granting of a preliminary permit, now under consideration, to Premium Energy Holdings (FERC Docket # P-15056.

The company claims that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the Catskills Forest Preserve.  But a study of the proposed sites shows that they are within the Preserve - which was established in 1885 by the New York State Constitution.  A constitutional amendment would be required to change the use of lands meant to be kept forever as wild lands.

The company also claims that this would be a closed loop system - but a review reveals that it would be an open loop system which would affect the Stony Clove and Woodland Valley Creeks.  It would also negatively affect the Ashokan Reservoir, proposed as the lower reservoir and the source of 40% of New York City’s drinking water, with turbidity due to fluctuations of pumped water.

I understand, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program and therefore are to be avoided for development.   Damage will be done to wildlife habitat, including protected species.

For all the above reasons I urge you to deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit.

Sincerely yours,

RE: The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project

We all know time goes on and takes technology with it. But one has to weigh the positive and negative impact of technology on those who it interacts with.

Do we want to flood areas of our community where folks lived and have lived for decades? No!
Do we want to relocate families? No!
Do we want high voltage power lines running right past our house? No!

What are the positives of this plan? That Central Hudson can generate more electricity during the off peak hours to use during peak time? That the company involved putting this all together can make a lot of money doing it?

What are the negatives? Many, many families will be impacted. Their entire lives will have to change. Their serene existence in the Hudson Valley, in the Catskill Mountains will be disrupted. Many will be exposed to the - not disproven - health effects of power lines. Property values will go down for all near those lines. 

We don’t want it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Virginia Workstus under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/30/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Virginia Workstus, Olivebridge, NY.

Re: FERC project proposal by Premium Energy Holdings 
subdocket # P-15056-000


I have lived full time in Olivebridge, NY for the past 20 years. I want to share my opinion to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a large dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. I oppose this proposed project.

This proposed project is intrusive and will negatively impact the ecology of the Catskill Forrest Preserve, which is protected by the New York State Constitution.  This project is likely to uproot area residents, damage or relocate local roads, damage local lands and streams and cause increased turbidity in waters which are a part of the watershed serving New York City’s unfiltered drinking water system.

This project will be a net consumer of energy, meaning that cheap power will be spent to make more expensive power.  This is short sighted and does not support responsible development of green energy production, which I do support. 

The Ashokan watershed has endured and continues to endure environmental stress.  The local ecosystem faces ongoing challenges to its health.  Pumped storage systems such as the one proposed creates rapid water level fluctuations of the upper reservoir.  These “wreak havoc on ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and fresh water ecosystems overlap.”  

I understand that infrastructure projects like this one often involves trade-offs between the negative impacts and positive good.  The Catskill Preserve and surrounding wilderness areas support the local economies of area towns and individuals.  The current New York City reservoir system sacrificed 33 towns, displacing thousands of residents.  Many area communities such as Olivebridge continue to struggle to survive and depend on tourist dollars.  This proposed project will stress already stressed communities.

This area is not the best suited place to build this proposed system.  Please work to prevent this proposal from moving forward.  Thank you.

Dear Ms. Bose,

This letter is concerning docket #P-15056-000.

I am writing to express my support for renewable energy, but my opposition to this plan in particular. Premium Energy (PE) has clearly given little to no consideration to the area that they are proposing to build this hydropower dam. 

There are a number of flaws in PE’s proposal. The first being that PE is calling the Ashokan Pumped Storage plan a “closed-loop” system. This is blatantly false. The proposed upper reservoir would rely on the lower reservoir (the current Ashokan reservoir) as a water source. This makes the plan patently an “open-loop” plan.

Number two. The Ashokan reservoir, which PE’s proposed plan will rely heavily on, is an integral and majority resource in NYC’s water supply. The Ashokan provides around 40% of the water supply to New York City’s over 9 million residents. Allowing PE’s plan to go forward would mean increased turbidity and sediment to the Ashokan, not to mention possible risk to overall supply. As climate change continues to affect our world, it’s impossible to know whether the levels of the Ashokan will remain stable in the coming years. 

Thirdly, tt seems with willful ignorance, that Premium Energy has chosen one of this region’s largest continuous wildlife preserves, under the protection of the New York Constitution, as the locale for a hydroplant designed to supply backup power.The sites in question are home to numerous under-threat and endangered species, including the:

	•	Cooper’s hawk
	•	Red-shouldered hawk
	•	Sharp-shinned hawk
	•	Eastern hognose snake
	•	Timber rattlesnake


Premium Energy’s proposal claims the hydroplant would generate 2,800 mega watts of power, but would require 2,000 mw of that power just to operate the plant itself. This equation does not make a strong case for the sacrifice of hundreds of acres of protected wildlife habitat to be wiped out.

I thank you in advance for considering the above points. Again, renewable energy is an important part of our future, and one that I value. However, this plan from Premium Energy is not sound, and should not be allowed to move forward.


Sincerely,

I am opposed to the project plan in docket P-15056.  This is the wrong kind of plan for my home area. While I am supportive of alternative energy projects, and recognize that trade-offs are almost always part of energy advancement, this plan has so little energy gain it is not worth the costs and risks. The areas that would be impacted are highly preserved land, and there will be devastating impact to preserved land and streams. Preservation has been hard won over many years, and this plan will undo those gains in a number of areas.  Also, we are going to see a parade of legal ramifications and entanglements emerge if this plan moves forward; I will join them and encourage my neighbors to join them, because they are justified in challenging this wrong approach by Premium Energy. This project impacts wildlife, local tourism and historical preservation, including for Native American history.  The Catskills Preserve in my county of Ulster has been working for over 135 years, and under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution the wording states that the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills hold Status 1 land designation under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Department. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision: “Areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”

My name is George Kraemer (52 Old Farm Road, Shokan, NY 12481), and I submit here my comments on the pumped storage hydro plant proposed for locations adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir (FERC project number P-15056, sub-docket number P-15056:000).

I understand and applaud the commitment to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the proposed pumped storage project has numerous negatives, based on location and environmental impact.  These negatives far outweigh the benefits gained by the project.  

Pumped storage reservoirs are environmentally detrimental.  The recently discovered phenomenon of methane emission from anoxic bottom sediments negates much of the switch from fossil fuel combustion to renewable sources.  Methane has ca. 25-times the potential for global warming of carbon dioxide. 

The Department of Energy’s Mission Innovation initiative has as its mission the research and development of clean energy.  Pumped storage is a net consumer of energy.  It is also relatively inefficient, requiring massive volumes of pumped water to store significant energy.  An environmentally better alternative is demand side management of electricity demand to reduce the need for pumped storage.  Pumped storage fails to be either innovative or clean.  

Ecologically, the rapid fluctuations of the water level in pumped storage prevent the development of a diverse, functional community.  Additionally, seasonal discharges of excess water from the proposed upper reservoir will seriously alter the hydraulics of the local creeks, incising stream beds and removing finer sediments and substrates, resulting in loss of biological integrity; the creeks will no longer be functioning parts of the biological landscape, but rather simply canals to release unneeded water.  These sediments will be transported into the Ashokan Reservoir, degrading the water quality of a major (40%) supplier of drinking water to New York City.  

New York State has long recognized the value of conserving wild lands, having the strongest “forever wild” clause of any state’s Constitution.  This 1894 clause directs that state-owned Catskill lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands.  They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.”  Whether New York State legislators of 125 years ago knew it or not, conservation of undisturbed wild land is key to the ecological integrity of the whole; many forest fragments do not add up to the same ecological entity as an intact forest.

Summarized succinctly, while the grid may need additional energy storage, and pumped storage is one means of achieving that, the proposed locations simply poor choices.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ana Silva under P-15056.

Concerning docket P-15056:000
  I’m writing in opposition to the proposal for a pumped storage hydro project in the Catskills Forest Preserve. As a resident of West Shokan and also as a consumer of New York City drinking water, I believe this is not an appropriate choice of site. Having seen parts of the proposal, it strikes me that your company has not considered many of the essential aspects of this region that make it a terrible location. 
  Under the NYS constitution, Article XIV, the Catskills forests “shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private”. Indeed, this area is pristine Status 1 preserve. It shall be forever kept as wild forest lands”.
  Aside from the huge disruption to and destruction of ecosystems, small roadways and homes and impact on local tourism, the potential for silty runoff into the NYC water system is cause enough for this project to be moved elsewhere. Please let us keep the Catskills as pristine forest lands.

This comment is written by a full time resident of the reservoir area on 3/31/21.  I’m Susanna Nicholson, at 170 Chase Rd. Shokan NY 12481.

Our area is a recreational jewel, an absolutely essential animal habitat.  Shokan also features a critical resource for the security and health of our state:  the Ashokan Reservoir, serving millions of NY State residents with clean, beautiful mountain water.

The assaults on natural habitat and water quality have never had more serious consequences than now, a time when water is truly an endangered resource nationwide.  Siting two powerhouses on the reservoir threatens our clean water, especially as the heat index already rises annually with climate change, and aquatic plant growth increases with CO2.  

Let’s pause here to remind ourselves that NY State has committed to renewable energy growth *with restrictions* as part of “Governor Cuomo’s Nation-Leading Climate Agenda”: “[projects will be] … responsibly permitted, bolster the state’s economy, and deliver health, environmental, and economic benefits to all New Yorkers.”  And I would like to draw your attention to one of the signal responsibilities of the Renewable Energy Siting Office:

“[to] achieve a net conservation benefit to any impacted endangered and threatened species.”

That is simply not possible with this project: the destruction of numerous woodland habitats through demolition and dams, the loss of recreational revenue and natural beauty, and the changing temperatures, pH, and soil content in important wetlands and estuaries downstream of the proposed dams and powerhouse.  The health and environmental aspects could not be worse.  If anyone imagines this enhances the quality of water arriving to NYC, I’d like to see the evidence.

Our future energy needs will be more efficiently met with other sources. I think we should wait to see what the Biden infrastructure plan offers our state in terms of federal funding for renewables such as solar and wind.  Our county has proven especially hospitable to solar projects, and those would be more consistent with existing land use patterns.

Also:

Why have we banned fracking in NY if we’re going to allow this Rube-Goldberg, comically-complex scheme of new reservoirs, dams, and powerhouses, privately run by out-of-state speculators?  

Given the complexity of this project, the environmental impact review process alone will run the state into the millions, or it will be shortchanged to expedite matters, with profound costs to the quality of life in Ulster and downstate counties.  There will be an extraordinary amount of litigation … all for an obviously inefficient project with catastrophic implications for NY State wildlife and forest.  

The required deforestation also seems ill-timed given our state’s priorities on climate change.

The Catskills are one of the things that make life in NY with its high taxes and demanding regulatory structures, really worthwhile for ALL of us.   Don’t ruin it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Nivo Rovedo under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Nivo Rovedo, Lagrangeville, NY.
My comment is in regards to the project known to FERC by docket number P-15056, the Ashokan Reservoir pumped storage project. Premium Energy Holdings 
(PEH) has requested a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study a pumped storage project on New York City’s Ashokan Reservoir. As a resident nearby the Catskill region,  I am against permitting this. My reason has to do with the location of this proposal and the significant adverse impacts it would have on water quality, the environment, and local Ulster County economy to name but a few effects. I am generally very much in favor of renewable energy storage projects, but this one is ill-conceived and can do incredible damage to the water supply of many towns, including New York City, and to the  environment.
  PEH requested the FERC permit without consulting with New York City (NYC); NYC’s Department of Environmental Protection had no prior knowledge of this proposal. This is crucially important because millions of people depend on the Ashokan Reservoir for drinking water, in New York City and many communities north of the city. We cannot afford to damage this precious, essential resource in any way! I feel that PEH, being a California based developer, is not familiar with how crucial and sensitive this body of water is to the region.
   As part of NYC’s water supply system, the Ashokan meets approximately forty percent of the City’s water needs, plus supplies water for some twenty communities as it travels south.  This water is currently unfiltered. The Ashokanis the oldest of NYC’s six Catskill water supply impoundments and the second largest.  But it is the only NYC Catskill reservoir that was constructed with two separate basins, an east and west basin.  The upper, or west basin, was constructed to serve as a settling basin allowing the periodic turbid reservoir inflows to settle out.  Since the reservoir’s construction in 1915, over one hundred years of sedimentation have settled in the west basin, where Premium Energy Holdings seeks to construct its pumped storage facility.The pumping and releasing of water from and into the Ashokan would potentially keep water turbid, thus negatively affecting its drinking quality, if not filtered.
   Additionally, the action of the pumped storage project would disrupt the reservoir’s thermocline. The Ashokan currently is a two-story reservoir that stratifies into a warm layer top and cold-water bottom during part of the year.  As such, it supports a healthy population of wild rainbow and brown trout.  Rainbow trout, which the Esopus Creek is best known for, are sight feeders that fed on zooplankton.  Zooplankton require clear water to thrive.  Thus, operation of a pumped storage project could create a constant turbid state, adversely impacting both zooplankton and the rainbow trout population.  And loss of the cold-water regime would further negatively impact the reservoir’s trout population. 
   For decades the Ashokan Reservoir-Esopus Creek connection of spawning rainbows and browns, running out of the reservoir, upstream into the Esopus to reproduce, has been much written about and heartily pursued.  In fact, the Esopus Creek wild trout fishery is dependent upon spawning trout from NYC’s Ashokan Reservoir.  Under a recently revised NYS Trout Management Plan the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) recognized the significance of the Esopus Creek trout fishery, classifying the river as Wild-Quality AND all its tributaries as Wild, that is to say, there is more than adequate spawning of wild trout to maintain these fisheries.  These are classifications very few NYS streams attain, and a recognition of the intrinsic value of these waters.If allowed to proceed, the proposed project would impact the watershed trout fishery: the Ashokan, Esopus, and tributaries where trout spawn.
   In addition, a major issue is that portions of the upper reservoirs would be constructed on NYS Forest Preserve lands; this would be a direct violation of the NYS Constitution.  While all of the aforementioned are environmental impacts, they are also economic impacts to Ulster County.  Much of the Ulster County economy is recreation based, with angling an important contributor.  Additionally, communities along the Esopus Creek, downstream of NYC’s Ashokan Reservoir have long since raised concerns about turbid discharges from the water supply.  These concerns can only be exacerbated if this project goes forward.
    Clearly this project is an ill-convinced idea by a west-coast based company with little knowledge, nor care, to impacts caused to the water quality, environment, economy, history, and general well-being of people living in the general area of this proposed endeavor.
     Please reject this permit request for all the reasons above.
    Thank you.
Nivo Rovedo</pre><hr><b>Comments of Lynne Sherbondy under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Lynne Sherbondy, West Shokan, NY.
I am a resident of West Shokan in the Town of Olive in Ulster County, NY.

The preliminary permit application, entitled The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, currently before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)includes building a large dammed reservoir in a New York State forest, an underground hydropower plant in West Shokan, and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the Town of Ulster. If allowed to proceed, this project will have enormous detrimental impact on our community. 

I am opposed to The Ashokan Pumped Storage Project for three reasons:

1. The Premium Energy proposal is not the kind of innovation the Department of Energy (DoE) wants.
   • Premium Energy is proposing an open-looped pumped-storage hydropower project where the lower reservoir will be continuously connected to a naturally flowing upper reservoir. Closed-loop projects are considered to have smaller environmental impact and are thus eligible for streamlined FERC approval. 
   • Premium Energy is claiming this to be a “closed-loop.” It is not. Projects where an upper reservoir is added to an existing lower reservoir are known as “add-on” projects. That is what this project is. Premium Energy is lying. 
   • “Initial construction impacts” for open-loop projects are lower, but “operational impacts are still likely to be higher than for a closed-loop project because the add-on project’s lower reservoir is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed for its original construction.” (Source: DoE: “A Comparison of the Env. Effects of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower.” April 2020)

2. Impact on highly preserved land
   • The Catskills Forest Preserve was created in 1885 in Ulster County. As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the DoE’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
     o Under Article XIV of the NYS Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” 
     o The Preserve is 700,000 acres of continuous wildlife habitat in an increasingly fragmented environment; the forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. 
     o All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area. 
   • Premium Energy appears to be completely unaware that they are proposing a project in an extremely protected state preserve, a Status 1 area according to the USGS Gap Analysis. Change in the State Forest Preserve is rare:
      o Changes to land management in the State Forest Preserves must be passed by constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature, then submitted to the public in a referendum. 
      o As of 1999, more than 2,000 amendments have been proposed. Only 29 made it to the referendum stage; of those, 20 passed. 
      o Source: The Catskill Park: Inside the Blue Line 

3. Impact on stream ecology 
   • Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats. 
   • Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills’ most vital trout waters and part of the New York City water supply.
   • A valuable trout breeding habitat will be lost.

proposal is shocking, outrageous and totally ill considered! And it shows NO knowledge, respect or concern for the Catskills and its people—and NYC. Clean, fresh water is the Catskills greatest resource. Which is why we have fought so hard against fracking—and won! Our tourist industry is dependent on that water, for fishing and so many other recreational activities. In addition, the Catskills has many family farms, and fresh water is crucial for livestock, cows, sheep and increasingly horses, and of course, it is also necessary for agriculture. The Catskills are America’s first great wilderness, lost in the 19th century to other irresponsible uses, such as the destruction of the hemlock forests by the tanning industry. Due to protections, such as codifying the Catskill Park as Forever Wild in NYS law (and how does this irresponsible proposal get around THAT?), the Catskills and its waters, which were thoroughly polluted by past egregiousness, have revived. Our streams and rivers offer some of the best fly fishing, as the trout, along with many mountain critters, such as the white-tailed deer and black bear, have returned with our reforested slopes and clean water.. Our waters also, and crucially,  supply drinking water to New York City, and the Ashokan Reservoir is the main reservoir whose sweet, clean waters flow to downstate. This project would put that water supply at risk!  And according to one article, the DEP, in addition to the Catskill towns concerned, was not even notified? And according to the same article, a Catskill town would be flooded for this? Absolutely not! That happened to too many villages to build the reservoirs. Catskillers, folks native to this area and the many downstaters now increasingly living here—and lots more have moved here due to the pandemic—simply won’t stand for this. This project would alter the hydrology of our local waters, the Esopus Creek, for starters, affect the quality of our water for recreational and drinking uses, both on a personal and commercial level, and also—and just as important—impact our wildlife, which has struggled and finally succeeded in making a comeback here. The Catskills, as anyone making such an irresponsible proposal, soon learns, are home to many committed, passionate and EFFECTIVE grass-roots environmental groups and individuals who will resist any such efforts that would result in compromising in any way our precious natural resources.

My family and I moved up here from New Jersey approximately 9 years ago as we saw firsthand the destruction of land and waterways that was so obvious from Energy Companies such as Southern California called Premium Energies.  My family and I object to this underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir or for that matter any land or waterway in the Catskill Region.  The Great People of the Catskills do not need this not do want any Energy Company being intrusive onto our land and communities that we here in the Catskills hold so dear.
Again, The Chazik Family stands firm as being vehemently opposed to this or for that matter any hydroelectric plant in our communities.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Edmund Earle under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Edmund Earle, Olivebridge, NY.
I was disturbed to learn of the recently proposed hydroelectric overhaul of the region by Premium Energy Holdings. Residents of the Catskills are keenly aware of our area&#39;s past exploitation, and to have a company propose continuing that tradition is the antithesis of what we stand for.

I am also fully aware of how easy it would be for these concerns to be dismissed as knee-jerk, or based on an incomplete understanding of the project. So instead I&#39;ll approach it with the objective question: would such a project produce more good or more harm? 


From what information is available, the good seems pretty minimal: 

-Premium Energy Holdings employs and shareholders will see a benefit.
-Such projects can contribute to reducing our overall dependence on fossil fuels. (However any climate-change gains may be undercut by the energy and resources required for production and operation.)


Meanwhile the harm caused by such a project seems far greater:

-Permanent alteration and destruction of the regions water systems.  I&#39;ve seen first-hand how even year-to-year changes in rainfall have had drastic impacts on our local streams, ponds, rivers, and overall watershed: recurring summer dry spells have meant even existing reservoirs have been dangerously low, as has the water table we rely on for our home wells. This is the time for us to be working to preserve our water sources, not altering them further. As others have brought up, this issue affect not just the Catskills region but New York City itself, which relies on our existing reservoirs for its water supply.

-Displacement of and negative impact on the region&#39;s peoples. This project will inevitably lead to people&#39;s homes being destroyed. This is something we have been through before with the construction of the existing Ashokan reservoir, a time we do not look back on fondly. In addition such a project will affect every resident&#39;s ability to travel, as well as potentially damage the tourism industry that sustain towns from Woodstock to Phonecia to Hunter. 

-Massive losses to and displacement of wildlife. The Catskills are a unique oasis for flora and fauna that are otherwise struggling from climate change and human development. As mentioned before, it wasn&#39;t too long ago that most this area was clear-cut. Thanks to state protections our natural areas are finally beginning to return to their former glory- to the benefit of us all. To flood these areas and cut down acres of forest for powerlines and pipelines would be to undo all that progress.  

So it is for all these reasons that I believe a project of this nature would objectively be a detriment to the region, and I hope that Premium Energy Holdings will take this into consideration going forward.

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am contacting you in regards to the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal (P-15056). This proposal was developed by the private electric company Premium Energy, based in California, and involves the construction of a for-profit hydroelectric dam in Olive, Woodland, or Lanesville. The proposed dam would reach up to 300 feet and connect to the Ashokan Reservoir by a tunnel drilled under public and private land. This dam would be problematic for numerous reasons.

The dam would need to flood at least 200 acres to construct a new reservoir, which would negatively impact the ecology of the Catskills Forest Preserve, which is protected by the NY State Constitution. This would reduce the amount of recreational area available for hikers, and it would also endangered several threatened species.  Moreover, the dam would reduce the quality of New York City’s drinking water, as well as negatively affect the streams that locals and tourists use for fishing, boating, and swimming. Due to the damage the dam will inflict on the local area, tourism would decrease, and many of the nearby towns rely on tourist dollars for their revenue, which would hurt their communities.

My family owns a summer cabin that has stood for several generations. If the dam is built, it would directly impact the property.

Please help me and others stop the Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant proposal.

Thank you for your time.

This is a comment regarding the proposed Ashokan Pump Station. The proposal from Premier Energy is neglectful of the sensitive nature of the proposed site. Most specifically our reservoir water which will be turbid,  will wreck havoc on our environment- fauna and flora, high power transmission lines will be near homes and can be detrimental to health especially the young and elderly, and will effect tourism. 
Furthermore, Catskill Forest Preserve. 1885 states lands in this status 1 area are to be avoided for development.
Therefore, this project should not be under consideration.

re: FERC project sub docket # P-15056:000 &#34;Ashokan Pumped Storage Project&#34;

To whom it may concern: 

I would like to express my concern in regard to the above proposed project since all three possible locations would impact highly preserved land and stream ecology of the Catskill Forest Preserve.

Under the USGS &#34;Gap Analysis Program&#34; the Catskill Forest Preserve is considered Status 1 land. According to DOE&#39;s own Hydropower Vision &#34;areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS program are to be avoided for development&#34;.

Furthermore, the Catskill Forest Preserve is protected by the NYS constitution. Any changes to land management would require a constitutional amendment, to be voted on and passed by two consecutive sessions and then submitted to the public in a referendum.

Thirdly, Premium Energy is proposing this project to FERC as a &#34;closed loop project&#34;, a type of project the DOE supports. The above project is not a closed, but an open loop project since it involves the Ashokan Reservoir as the lower basin. which has the Esopus River running into it and out of it.

I live in Chichester, NY, near one of the proposed sites Premium Energy Holdings is considering for an upper reservoir that would connect to the Ashokan. After reading the proposal, and based on my knowledge of the area, I urge you to deny PEH a preliminary permit to conduct studies on a proposed pumped storage plant. The Catskill Forest Preserve is not the right place for this project, and this for-profit company’s proposal threatens to do more environmental and economic damage than it sets out to solve.
 
All three of the sites under consideration in Premium Energy’s proposal are within the Catskill State Park, which is protected from development by the NYS Constitution unless amended otherwise. These three sites also fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Areas. Further, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the United States Geological Survey’s “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.”
 
Pumped storage upper reservoirs are subject to rapid fluctuations of water which threaten both aquatic and land habitats. Altering the sediment regime in tributaries to the Esopus will alter the sediment regime in the Esopus, one of the Catskills most vital trout waters and part of New York City&#39;s water supply. Disrupting the local ecology and subjecting our local waters to cooling and evaporation are not the kinds of trade-offs we can afford. Nor is the potential to seriously harm New York City’s water supply.
 
Please deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit so that local experts can work toward genuine solutions to our energy needs.

     As a resident of Shandaken and the owner of a business in Phoenicia I am writing to voice my strong opposition to granting a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. I acknowledge and support the pursuit of renewable energy projects, but the Catskills is uniquely ill suited for the Premium Energy hydropower endeavor.
     Why is it &#34;uniquely&#34; ill suited?
     Premium Energy is proposing a project in the Catskills Forest Preserve - land under Article XIV of the NYS constitution that &#34;shall be forever kept wild forest...shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.&#34; Altering the land management for this project to move forward in the State Forest Preserve would require a state constitutional amendment, voted on by two consecutive sessions in the state legislature then submission to the public in a referendum. Such amendments rarely pass.
     The Department of Energy&#39;s &#34;Hydropower Vision&#34; recommends that land with formal protection designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program be avoided for development. As a State Forest Preserve the Catskills do fall into the Status 1 land designation.
     The Esopus Creek, one of the East Coast&#39;s most vital trout waters, will be adversely affected by the increased turbidity of the project causing irreparable damage to trout breeding grounds. The pristine Esopus Creek network is fragile and will never recover from such a massive disturbance to its delicate ecology.
     And let&#39;s use common sense. Let&#39;s use our nation&#39;s economic resources sensibly to make good choices in developing renewable energy resources. Think of the millions of dollars that will need to be spent by the parties involved for this project to move forward:
     - the associated costs of amending the state constitution.
     - the review process expenses incurred by the New York State agencies 
       in assessing the project&#39;s negative environmental impact.
     - the litigation expenses New York City will incur in reviewing and 
       fighting this proposal since it will so grossly endanger its water 
       quality.
     Wouldn&#39;t all this money be better used for a project that is better suited to succeed and have solid prospects for coming to fruition? This is not an issue of &#34;we don&#39;t want this project here.&#34; It&#39;s an issue of recognizing the disqualifying circumstances situating this project specifically in the Catskills  that make it prohibitive.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header6><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse6 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse6>

This proposal lacks in grounding or merit to it&#39;s proposed location. I&#39;m not sure if Premium Energy Holdings, LLC is simply throwing darts at a map right now, as that&#39;s the only possible way anybody could think a project like this would belong in this location:

1. On a general note power production is not a concern for the area to be met. We have issues as any rural area does with outages, but those are all from storms that disrupt the infrastructure, never from demand outpacing supply.
2. In order to build any of the proposals it would not simply mean imminent domain problems for residents and land owners but also getting land from the State of New York who holds land in all of the proposed areas, so they would be taking public land at the expense of every single resident in the state.
3. The Esopus Creek has just been given designation as a river of Wild-Quality by New York Department of Conservation.

The proposed project is out of scale to the area and not energy efficient. Moreover, each of the alternatives would potentially encroach on sensitive ecosystems, including Catskill Park/New York State forever wild lands.  We are all for renewable and sustainable energy.  But this project does not fit well here.

Our region is packed full of headwater streams and waterfalls that would lend themselves well to small hydro projects.  Why in the world would you want to pump water upstream to create a massive closed loop system?  This would be highly inefficient and totally unnecessary.  There are so many opportunities to work with the natural hydraulic corridors here. So why would anyone want to work against them?  Makes little sense – is it just to have a massive project that is not wanted by the locals here?  Exploring smaller scale projects would be so much smarter, and not infringe nearly as much on the beautiful ecosystem we have here.  Larger pumped power storage systems can be useful, but not here.

The future will be in energy efficiency, but this is not efficient.  Not only is there an obviously huge waste of energy in this proposed concept, but energy is also wasted as soon as it enters the grid.  It has been suggested that the pumping energy might be supplied by solar panels during the day. Where would you put those?  Raze our forever wild forest lands?  Or maybe you could construct them miles away and transmit the energy through transmission lines, wasting even more energy.

There are much better solutions to solving our energy challenges, so please don’t go down this short-sighted road.  We need to think further out into the future.  And while a massive concrete uphill holding reservoir is not a good long-term answer, it does have the potential to create long term and possibly permanent damage here.

RE:
FERC project and subdocket number: P-15056:000
Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project
The proposal before you, &#34;Premium Energy Holdings’ First Amendment for Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 15056-000,&#34; Document Accession #: 20210201-5022 Filed Date: 02/01/2021, suffers fatal deficiencies. Granting the urgent need for more renewable energy in New York State and nationally, this application for a preliminary permit should be rejected at the outset because the proposed sites are not the right places for this project.
The proposal states falsely on p. 5 that &#34;The location of the proposed project is: State or territory: New York, Counties: Ulster County&#34; and again falsely on p. 7 that &#34;Every county in which any part of the project, and any Federal facilities that would be used by the project, would be located. Ulster County.&#34; In fact, Exhibit 3, page 21, shows clearly that the proposed Stony Clove Reservoir and Dam along Route 214 are approximately 1 mile into Green County in the hamlet of Lanesville.
The proposal states falsely in Exhibit 1 on p. 11: &#34;The proposed Ashokan Pumped Storage Project would operate in a closed loop. Aside from evaporation and percolation losses, the project’s water would stay within the system.&#34; The Ashokan Reservoir, the proposed lower reservoir, is part of a flowing water system, fed from above by the Schoharie Reservoir, Esopus Creek, and smaller tributaries, and flowing downstream into Esopus Creek and the water-supply system of New York City (NYC). The Schoharie and Ashokan Reservoirs provide approximately 40% of the daily water supply of NYC&#39;s 9 million inhabitants. The water that would flush at high pressure (594-914 feet of head claimed in the proposal) and high velocity from any of the proposed upper reservoirs into the depth of the Ashokan Reservoir upper (western) basin would stir up a century&#39;s worth of sediment, add its own sediment, and commingle with the outflow to both NYC and Esopus Creek downstream. This is NOT a closed-loop system. It is an add-on project for open-loop pumped-storage hydropower because the proposed project’s lower reservoir, Ashokan Reservoir, is still continuously connected to, and may affect, the natural flowing water feature that was dammed to construct the Ashokan Reservoir.
The proposal states on p. 13 that approximately 15,800 acre-ft of water would be used for pumping or generating 800 MW over 12 hours of continuous output. The proposal also states on p. 13 that the Ashokan Reservoir has &#34;around 382,358 acre-ft of storage capacity. Also, additional water volume at Ashokan reservoir would be discharged through the Esopus Creek (southeast basin).&#34; That last sentence contradicts the proposal&#39;s earlier claim on p. 11 that this is a closed-loop system. But more importantly, the Ashokan Reservoir is divided by a spillway into a western basin upstream and an eastern basin downstream. Water is released from upstream to downstream. Therefore the western basin would take the full impact of the proposed 15,800 acre-ft of water. According to Adam Bosch at the NYC Department of Environmental Proection, the western basin has a surface area of 3,106 acres and a storage volume of 143,700 acre-ft when full.  So the daily rise and fall of the western basin would be 5.09 ft = 15800 ÷ 3106 and the 15,800 acre-ft pumped in each 12-hour power cycle would be 11% = 15,800 ÷ 143,700 of the western basin volume.  Every 9 days the entire volume of the western basin could turn over, assuming the western basin were full throughout. Most of the time, the western basin is far from full, so total turnover of the western basin would happen faster and the surface level fluctuation would be more extreme than 5 feet. Such mixing could not fail to perturb in disastrous ways the ecology within the Ashokan Reservoir, the ecologically rich areas where terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems overlap (as a result of the 5-foot surface water elevation fluctuation), and the quality of the water supplied to NYC.
The three sites proposed for the upper reservoir would cause major damage to highly preserved land in the Catskills Forest Preserve created in 1885 in Ulster County. Under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” As a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 2 land under the USGS “Gap Analysis Program.” According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.&#34; The forest around the proposed sites ranks among the top 1% of forest habitats region-wide according to the New York State Forest Condition Index. All proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area: see https:// www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas/catskills-peaks-area. The proposed project would destroy these irreplaceable natural areas, undermine the attractiveness of the area for tourism, weaken the local economy, pollute downstream, and possibly wreck one of NYC&#39;s major capital assets, its water supply system.
In conclusion, granting the urgent need for more renewable energy in New York State and nationally, this preliminary permit application should be rejected at the outset, because the Ashokan Reservoir and surrounding forests and mountains are not the right place for this project.

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 

 

I do understand and appreciate the need to create more truly renewable energy sources. We cannot allow typical NIMBY concerns to block all projects. 

 

However, this proposal is truly deficient, would cause massive and irreparable harm to protected lands and to people, and should be denied on its merits. The proposed sites in the Catskills region are on Status 1 land, and the Department of Energy has clearly stated that Status 1 or 2 land must be avoided for any development. The proposed project will cause severe ecological damage, particularly on streams resulting in increased turbidity and sediment in water that serve as an unfiltered drinking water source and blocking the natural spawning areas of trout and other wildlife.

 

Furthermore, the proposed project is not a true ‘closed loop” energy source and is not the type of innovation that is being sought; it could even result in a net loss of energy given its reliance on traditional pumping to higher elevations. 

 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I respectfully ask that you prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Leo J Warren under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/25/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Leo J Warren, Shokan, NY.
The Ashokan Reservoir Power Plant Proposal is not beneficial for this area or community. I am a town of Olive resident I grew up in Shandaken.  I am a property owner as well as a business owner in this area. This proposal is not displaying any benefit to this community. Only negative effects for the people and profits for a company that isn&#39;t based in New York.  It is a California based company coming into upstate New York to make money and destroy our community and lands. Coming into the area and acting like it is ok to relocate families in a time where people cannot find homes to live. This demonstrates the lack of care for our community. Hiding under the umbrella of renewable energy is unacceptable and creating a false vision of what it will do for our community. I am against this proposal. During the town board presentation a question was asked what&#39;s in it for the community the company representative replied it is renewable energy. They are not looking out for us the residents of this community they are looking out for their bottom line. One of the reasons we all live here is because of the community and lands. Allowing an organization to destroy our lands and potentially remove families from our community is unacceptable.</pre><hr><b>Comment of Mary M Schroeder in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056-000 Submission Date: 3/25/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Mary M Schroeder, Lanesville, NY.

Its hard to ignore the devastating impacts on the natural environment that this pumped-storage power plant will have. For one thing, as this PowerPoint is more than happy to inform us, the building of an upper-level reservoir will &#34;wreak havoc on both aquatic and land habitats&#34; but also &#34;[destroy] valuable trout breeding habitat&#34; (slide 26, Strand). As a matter of fact, the only benefits to building this plant that are ever outlined have little to no impact on the local residents surrounding the reservoir. The only benefits to this project are economical, and they only economically benefit New York City and the companies who are building it. 

I implore concerned individuals, activists, and anybody living around here to read that PowerPoint and ask yourself &#34;what will this do for me?&#34; The answer is, quite simply, nothing. 

My concern with this project is that the negative environmental and economic impacts of it will be bared only by the local people, and that this is yet another frightening example of a government overstepping their boundaries to make up for a lack of adequately and sustainably designed city infrastructure. The PowerPoint provided on the Town of Olive website does nothing to dissuade me from that.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Abby Heijnen under P-15056.

To whom it may concern,

This letter is to register my vigorous opposition to the above proposed Permit and project!
This proposal includes an inappropriate siting of  a large dammed reservoir in a NYS forest, an underground hydro plant in West Shokan and high voltage transmission lines running from Olive to the town of Ulster. ALL IN THE CATSKILL STATE PARK and surrounding area. 

The idea of this project in a pristine natural environment, where tourism is a major source of income for our communities, is absolutely unacceptable!

This California company is arbitrarily choosing sites all over the country for investment, without regard to the impact on our community.

The town of Olive has already suffered a loss of income from the building of the Ashokan reservoir and we, as residents, are required to comply with strict and extra costly regulations in order to keep New York City&#39;s water supply fresh and clean.

Though I am a supporter of clean energy, there must be consideration for appropriate locations.

Please deny them this permit and keep them, and anyone else, from building projects that would desecrate our natural environment.

There are several bald eagle nesting sites located along the Ashokan reservoir and in the areas for the 3 proposed reservoirs, what will be done to protect them and other wildlife? Why are  the transmission lines running on the southern side of the Ashokan Reservoir, instead of along NYS Route 28 on the northern side? Why do the proposed facilities need to be located 200-300 feet below ground level? Will the building of this effect the well water systems of local residents? How much noise, traffic disruption, dust, etc. can we expect from the construction of this? Since this will be underground, how much blasting will there be?

I am writing to you as a concerned Woodland Valley resident, who is against the proposed  underground hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir by the company Premium Energy Holdings LLC.

The  proposed locations for the new reservoirs would mean taking away private property from people and in one case – for the prospective WoodlandReservoir – involve flooding an entire community, Woodland Valley, which is the community that I live in. Additionally, this proposed plant poses potential issues with town infrastructure, individual wells, regional infrastructure as related to the electric grid, and environmental sensitivities.

The plant would utilize electricity to pump water to the upper reservoir.  This is inefficient and hardly innovation.  The public deserves a higher standard for an energy project.

The area is used for recreation.   The disruption of construction and the lasting impact on the natural resources in the area would have unforeseen economic impact.

Construction, ongoing operation, and potential accidents would have devastating impact on the aquatic environment in the immediate and surrounding areas.  This is totally unacceptable considering the history of the aquatic environment and its economic potential.

To whom it concerns:

I am writing about Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric plant in the Catskills. I live next to the Catskills and know the area well, as I hike in there every week. I know all three proposed locations. I am shocked at the choices, as they are all manifestly unsuitable for a project of this kind. 

Premium Energy’s proposal seems haphazard and sloppy and quickly put together without any real knowledge of the area, of the obvious impacts this project will have on this major tourism area, or of the laws that apply to these projects and the Catskill Park.

1. The Catskill Park is constitutionally protected as “forever wild&#34; and is highy preserved Status 1 Land. The Department of Energy has said that Status 1 or 2 must be avoided for development. Premium Energy seem unaware that their project will require an amendment to the State Constitution which protects the Catskill Park. 

2. This region is where fly fishing began in the United States and this project threatens to destroy that valuable legacy with sediment build-up which will decimate local trout habitat.

3. This project not kind of innovation DoE is looking for. This is not a true “closed loop” project. Premium Energy’s proposal is deficient. It does not deserve the streamlined application process.

Motion to Intervene of Dawn Peters for the Premium Energy Holdings, LLC,

As a resident in an impacted community and as a taxpayer in that community, Chichester in Ulster County, the State of New York, the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project will undoubtedly impact environmental resources and state constitutionally protected public land that I have a stakeholder interest in as a contributing taxpayer. 

The proposed Stoney Clove dam, located in Lanesville, would be approximately 1.25 miles north of my home and Stoney Clove Creek streamside property. This CEMENT BARRIER would be 2,600 feet in length and 212 feet high. EFFECTIVELY CHOKING the Stoney Clove Creek and altering the streambank and aquatic habitat of any plant or animal living in this cold water stream.

In light of the uncertainties of global warming, NO FEASIBILITY STUDY NOR COMPUTER MODELLING can predict the added consequences of a construction site and eventual dam, tunnels, high tension wires, turbines, etc., on the delicate balance of nature we have here in the Catskill Forest Preserve. 

Forests act as a filter. This natural filter keeps NYC&#39;s unfiltered drinking water system clean by preventing the runoff of chemicals and soil into waterways and eventually the upper Ashokan Reservoir, which already holds years of silt, sediment, etc. Locally, the dam would undoubtedly impact the area&#39;s water table, wells, MY WELL, stream turbidity, and ultimately, it would have to affect NYC&#39;s drinking water quality. Stoney Clove Creek, a source of life and sustenance, would inevitably be forever changed. 

I, Dawn Peters, respectfully request that the Commission grant my Motion to Intervene as a party with full rights to participate in all further proceedings. 

Respectfully submitted,
Dawn Peters

We understand the fact that the government has requirements to take appropriate action(s) for our future electric needs, and we understand the government’s thoughts that green energy style so-called renewable energy sources are considered the future.

The following are our concerns with this project’s three proposed locations:
•	Lanesville – This site is the farthest equating to the causing the most environmental damage running the pipeline through Phoenicia, Chichester, and Stoney Clove. It also involves the longest run of pipeline, which will make it the most expensive to operate insofar as the energy required to pump water from the Ashokan Reservoir to the Upper Reservoir, negating any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	Woodland Valley - Though Woodland Valley is much closer, by half the distance of Lanesville, it posses a very similar environmental damage issue, plus seems to eliminate access to the State campground and hiking trails which are a major attraction and revenue generator for the area.
•	Both the Lanesville and the Woodland Valley sites would require the pipeline extend through the Route 28 Corridor causing more environmental damage, raise the costs of pumping the water, and will further negate any expected financial gain in electricity.
•	MoonHaw Road – This site seems the best possible choice. It would involve the least amount of environmental damage and the least amount of pipeline, which would decrease the costs of pumping water, though I haven’t seen any data on at what length pumping becomes financially worthwhile.
•	All three locations would require further environmental damage for the power lines and connections to the grid the project requires.

We are also concerned about the overall environmental impact of this project and how it will affect the Ashokan Reservoir’s ecosystem as well as the ecosystems of the Esopus and other creeks, all of which need extensive study before a decision like this should be considered. Plus, the government needs to study the possible impact this could have on the downstate needs of NYC residents as it will have an impact on their drinking water supply. Furthermore, the entire Catskill Park Forest Preserve, of which this project falls within, could be drastically affected and will require extensive study to determine the impacts.

As stated in the bullets above, pumping water from the Ashokan Reservoir to another reservoir, by design, can only consume more energy than it creates, and we question where the energy to perform all that pumping is coming from as it sounds like it will require more fossil fuel utilization, not less.

As a last point, we understand that the concern over whether green energy investments reduce the costs of electricity to its citizens aren’t always a determining factor in government decisions, but this project goes beyond that consideration as, previously stated, it would all take place within the Blue Line of the Catskill Park Forest Preserve and be devastating to the ecosystem. As such, this project seems more appropriate for State land along the Hudson river where connecting to grid infrastructure would be much easier, cause less damage to the environment, and be part of a hydro ecosystem that is much more robust than the Esopus feed to the Ashokan reservoir will ever be.

In closing, we thank you for your consideration of our concerns and comments.

Hello. I am a resident of Jewett NY (northern Catskills) and Brooklyn NY. I am writing to voice my opposition to this proposal. I initially started researching this project because I&#39;m interested in pumped storage as a critical component of our clean energy future, and I would normally vocally support such a project to combat the NIMBY attitude. But I cannot support this project for a number of reasons. 
Primarily, this project would attempt to take state land within the Blue Line of the Catskills State Park which has been designated as forever wild. (I don&#39;t understand the legal mechanisms by which they could take this land without a state-wide referendum in addition to a vote by two consecutive sessions of our state legislature.) 
Secondly, this project would undoubtedly increase turbidity in the Ashokan Reservoir. Turbidity is already a big issue for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the city&#39;s water department.
This is the right project but in the WRONG location.
I truly support pumped-storage projects. (I work in environmental sustainability and climate resilience so I understand the issues.) But this is not the right location. Other projects that  (1) do not rely on protected state lands and (2) do not threaten the NYC drinking water system should be considered. If such a project comes forward, I will gladly support it in opposition to the NIMBY movement.

To whom it may concern,
As a local resident who walks, hikes, and enjoys fishing in the upper and lower Esopus creek as well as in the Ashokan reservoir, it seems hard to believe FERC would even propose such a disastrous project and flood even more homes and properties in the Catskills. It is very clear that this proposed project would displace residents, destroy natural habitat, and create an unwelcome ecological disaster within the Catskill watershed. The “power plant” as designed would warm the waters of the Ashokan Reservoir to the extent that the trout population would dwindle, and the habitat would be severely harmed.
I vigorously oppose this proposed project and request that the Federal Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am a resident of Chichester, NY (Ulster County), and I am writing against the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings – their proposal is both misleading and deficient.

I am a citizen who cares deeply about reducing our country’s reliance on fossil fuels. I believe we ought to transition to renewable energy, and there are many good things to be said for hydropower. However, the Catskills area is not the right place for this kind of project. The damage that would be done to state preserved forest land, waterways, and wildlife is immeasurable.

Importantly, Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal is misleading and deficient: While the company says it won’t touch the Catskills Forest Preserve, its actual plan locates the project right in the heart of the Catskills Preserve, which is 700,000 acres of land protected by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution. The Article states these lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” If the company wants to change the land management of the State Forest Preserve, a constitutional amendment is required, one that is voted on twice by the NY state legislature and submitted to the public in a referendum. 

In a hydropower project, the fluctuations of pumped water would increase the turbidity of the New York City water supply (the Catskills water supply provides 40% of New York City’s drinking water). Perhaps more importantly, it would wreak havoc on land and aquatic habitats. All of the natural streams that would be affected are vital trout waters, and important trout spawning grounds would be destroyed.

The Catskills Forest Preserve is 700,000 contiguous acres of wildlife habitat. Premium Energy’s proposed reservoirs fall within Audubon’s Catskill Peaks Important Bird Area and on land that is home to many protected species: 

•	“threatened species” such as the northern long-eared bat; 
•	“species of greatest conservation need” such as the black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush; 
•	“species of special concern” such as Cooper’s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, Eastern hognose snake, and timber rattlesnake. 

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal is also misleading in that it is described as a closed-loop system when it is clearly presented as an open-loop design.  Both the Stony Clove and Woodland Valley upper reservoir designs involve and affect the free-flowing Stony Clove and Woodland Valley Creeks.  I live on the Stony Clove and know that, since 1995, the Stony Clove has received funding from the NYC DEP Stream Management Program, the US Army Corps of Engineers under the Watershed Environmental Assistance Program, and NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (http://www.catskillstreams.org/stonyclovesmp.html).  This significant investment in time, money, and resources has greatly improved turbidity / water quality and and the health of the Creek’s ecology.

The damage that this proposed project would inflict on the ecology of state protected land is immense and unimaginable. I urge you to protect our natural resources and deny Premium Energy Holdings a preliminary permit.

 Please require Premium Energy to, at the very least, resubmit their application for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project. As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, their proposal is not a closed loop system, as represented, and as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re also aware, there are numerous other factual errors in their application.

 This project, if ultimatly allowed to go forward (at any level) would have a negative impact of such magnitude effecting countless entities, that the result will be immediate and continuous pushback and never ending litigation. In my opinion, it will become increasingly obvious that Premium Energy didn&#39;t spend the time  and effort necessarty for proper proposal of such a plan and its location.
This is simply not the place for this project. I believe this will become increasingly obvious, to the extent this plan is allowed to go forward. I am also  of the belief, based on my experience of 45 years as a trial attorney and from what I&#39;ve seen thus far here (both from Premium Energy&#39;s initial application and the resulting reaction to same in the short time it&#39;s been public) that ultimately this project will not go forward in this location. How much time and money end up wasted remains to be seen.

I have concerns about the impacts of the proposed dams that are part of the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.  I see no information concerning the impacts of a dam on the fish in the stream that will be dammed nor any indications that the dam will be designed to not impact local fisheries.  Also, I have seen indications that the increased inflow to the Ashokan Reservoir will cause increased turbidity.  The turbidity of the water in the reservoir is already a cause for concern as it impacts the lower Esopus Creek. 
 
Our area is known for outdoor activities, especially trout fishing.  Any damage to the environment, especially to the streams, will have impacts on the ecology and the economy of the region.  Once any damage is caused by construction such as with dams, it is difficult to recover from.  The impacts need to be fully assessed and discussed before any permitting is allowed.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jennifer Vallance in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I value the environment and hope to seek out renewable energy sources but do not think this is in the best interest of the Town.  I raised a few concerns with FERC re: the impact on the quality of the water and the surrounding land.  Each member, all from different departments, indicated that “can be a concern”.  If they feel that way, then it is of deep concern to me as I’m sure it must be to the millions of people who live in NYC (as this is the main source of their water supply).

In addition, the proposal of additional, yet smaller, reservoirs bothers me for the simple fact that we already have several flood zones in the area and have gone to great time and expense to avoid the potential for flooding.  Over time and with the potential for erosion mentioned in several of FERC’s studies, I can only see this as a problematic area that will need to be addressed down the line.

Additionally, the State has gone to great expense to provide the Rail Trail which draws great crowds during all four seasons of the year.  Offering hiking, biking, etc. and the observation of many species of birds and other animals (some nearing extinction or on the wildlife protection list).  A project such as this will surely be a disruption to them in their natural habitat.

I think most people agree we all want to preserve the planet we share but it is hard to justify doing it this way when the health of many may suffer, the natural habitat may disappear and all that is beautiful about this area will be torn apart in the process.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Everest Schmidt in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I write as a resident of Olive that I am concerned about the proposed placement of the hydro electric dam and power plant. From my understanding, this project will have a significant negative environmental and ecological effect on lands, at least partially, protected by New York’s Constitution. See Article XIV, Section 1, of the New York Constitution (“The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.”) How many trees will be decimated in these beautiful Catskills mountains to string high voltage power lines and the bulldozing for a reservoir.

What remains of the wild must be protected. The natural beauty of these mountains draws  thousands of visitors from all over the world to these small communities, thus helping sustain our small businesses. Any kind of massive construction project, such as the proposed plan, should be looked at with strict scrutiny. 

This application should be denied.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marisa Ann Perez Rogers under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/23/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Marisa Ann Perez Rogers, Shokan, NY.

The following is written by a 10-year-old adversary to the pumped hydro project proposal.

The scent of trees drifts through the air. The Esopus Stream is making its way through the rocks. In my opinion the dam should not be built that will drown Woodland Valley and flood this stream. The dam should not be built because it is home to many plants and animals, people live there, the water won’t be the prettiest, there is a lot of history, and it uses more energy than it creates.         

First off, Woodland Valley is home to many plants and animals. Their homes would be destroyed and they would most likely die. Most of Woodland Valley&#39;s natural beauties are because of them. This makes Woodland Valley the perfect destination for wildlife lovers. As you can see Woodland Valley is home to many plants and animals.

My second reason is that people live there. They would have to move out of their houses not because they wanted to. There is even a whole colony that has made many traditions specific to that piece of land. Also would you like to have someone tell you you have to move out of your house and go somewhere else? To sum it up people live there and you would be wrecking their homes and properties.

Third, the water isn’t the prettiest. It isn’t the blue waters of Hawaii. The mountains are the Valley’s prettiest aspect. Sure water is fun but why bring more of it to a perfectly fine creek. To conclude the water isn’t the prettiest. 

Lastly, it is going to use more energy than it creates. First, it is just a silly idea if you have to drown places just to take energy and produce less than you took. Secondly, energy is not a toy, you are supposed to treasure it and not use it irresponsibly. Also, there are other environmental friendly options to produce energy that don’t involve a dam and water. In conclusion this way of making electricity is a bad idea because it is going to use more energy than it is going to create.

As you can see the dam should not be built. Not only is Woodland Valley home to many examples of wildlife, but there are many people who call it home, the water won’t be the prettiest, there is a lot of history, and it is going to use more energy than it creates. So call the building of the dam off and save the valley.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Julia Muro under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/23/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Julia Muro, Durham, CT.

Pumped Storage Electrical Generating Systems consume MORE electricity than they produce.  It takes more energy to pump water to the upper reservoir than is produced when the water flows back downhill.  The advantage to pumped storage is that the electricity costs less to move the water uphill because that happens typically at night when electricity demand is low.  The electricity produced when the water flows down is more valuable because that happens when electrical demand is high. Pumped storage can be a net producer of electricity only if a stream or river adds water to the upper reservoir.

The advantage to pumped storage besides the economics for the electric company is that it is more reliable since wind or sunlight are not factors like in &#34;green&#34; generating systems.

To build a pumped storage system would require dams, reservoirs and tunnels.  The disruption and habitat loss, as well as monetary cost, is not justified.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Marisa Beauchemin under P-15056.

I am writing to oppose the Ashokan Hydroelectric pumped storage facility that Premium Energy Holdings has proposed in the Catskill region of New York (P-15056-000). 

I volunteer with the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference to maintain one of the trails accessed from the Woodland Valley Campground within the Catskill Forest Preserve, in an area that would be flooded by the proposed upper reservoir of this project. Our public campgrounds, trails, and streams are some of the most popular in the Catskill Forest Preserve, and attract people from all walks of life, including anglers, endurance athletes, thru-hikers on the Long Path, young families, and people simply looking for a change of scenery from urban life. New York State parks, trails, campgrounds, and historic sites saw a record 78 million visits in 2020, surpassing the previous record set in 2019 [1]. Our public lands were ever more important during a year of grief and isolation, and public campgrounds are a vital resource in the movement to make outdoor recreation more welcoming to people of color and other marginalized groups. Flooding Woodland Valley to create an upper reservoir for open-loop pumped hydropower energy storage would destroy this beloved resource.

In all three of the proposed locations, creating an upper reservoir by flooding the valley would destroy homes and communities, remove access to our public lands, and destroy the livelihoods of people who work adjacent to tourism in the region. The alternative site for the reservoir in Lanesville would destroy the recreational resources of the Devil’s Tombstone Campground and the fly fishing along Stony Clove. The proposed site in West Shokan would also destroy a residential center and a popular trailhead at the end of Moonhaw Road. 

All three of the proposed locations would encroach on the boundaries of the Catskill Forest Preserve, land that is designated by the New York State Constitution as “forever wild.” Encroaching on the forest preserve is difficult, as it should be: it requires a state constitutional amendment, two consecutive votes in state legislature, and a referendum. I urge you to reject this project swiftly, and not waste the time of your own agency and that of our state agencies tasked with protecting our public lands.

Dear Governor Cuomo:

There is a proposal, which is part of the Premium Energy Proposal,  to build a new, 225-acre reservoir and dam running 1/2 mile long in West Shokan.    Much of the construction would be underground, but it’s unclear to me whether there would be blasting and depredation of the visual environment were the dam to be approved. The environment here is the chief reason my late wife and I moved here 24 years ago. 
 
I received a flyer from a local group with whom I usually have few dealings, so the actual impact of the project is unclear to me. I note that property values here have soared in recent months, and the question needs to be asked whether the destructive effects on real estate values and the environment (the project abuts hiking trails and state campgrounds) will equal the economic gain from additional electricity.  Houses here that were worth $150,000 two years ago are now worth $400,000. The demand for outdoor recreation has also soared.
 
The city has a history, which goes back 120 years, of pursuing projects of benefit to the city without concern for costs to the Town of Olive.   I doubt that the costs have been accurately assessed, nor is it clear what the environmental damage will be, nor is it clear that the funds will be available to complete a long-term project.

I have lived in the Ashokan Reservoir area for over 40 years. While I have seen many changes, there is one feature that endures.  The Ashokan Reservoir remains a spectacular natural habitat for many species - while some are endangered all of them matter.  Most important, the habitat endures as a natural haven only a hundred miles from one of the world’s great metropolitan areas; and is a symbol to our commitment to the environment. This habitat then goes on to effortlessly provide clean, quality, pure water to that city of 9 plus million.  While Pumped Storage facilities offer promise and while it is an emerging technology, the Ashokan Reservoir is the wrong site for this.This will be a massive project and will disrupt and destroy this very valuable habitat, regardless of the assurances anyone can provide.

The Proposed Hydroelectric Plant at the Ashokan Reservoir is a poorly thought out attempt at producing sustainable energy. Premium Energy have not provided
enough information on this project to warrant hand waving of any part of their
proposal. To create an inefficient hydroelectric plant that must pump water uphill to yield energy in the first place is a poor plan. On top of this, building on status 1 land is just inviting a legal battle that could end up delaying this project for a long time. If the state of New York wants to get sustainable energy to its citizens right away, then why try to take land that will require an amendment to the New York State constitution, which protects the Catskills. With Joe Biden now president, there is a solid chance that nuclear power plants in the state of New York will have the funding to reopen sometime in the next four years. In addition to this, wind and solar can easily be substituted with a much smaller environmental impacts on one of New York&#39;s greatest treasures. The untouched Catskills region is the primary reason that I, as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, visit and spend money in the state of New York. Please take time to solicit more reasonable and thought out sustainable energy proposals before rushing into any attempts to fundamentally alter the Catskills region.

This proposal is almost laughable.  All of the proposed sites are status 1 land which should be avoided per DOE.  Further, any development in this area would require an amendment to the NYS Constitution.  The region in question has already suffered due to the extensive network of NYC drinking water reservoirs.  Further, this are is used extensively for recreational pursuits, including hiking, camping, fishing and hunting.

Dear Kimberly D. Bose,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ plan to build a hydroelectric plant in the Ashokan Reservoir region of Ulster County.

As my husband, in-laws, and several members of our extended family have indicated in their own comments, our family has owned a house in Woodland Valley for more than 75 years. The house and the valley it sits in are a family heirloom. While we own the house, the valley and its natural and beauty are accessible to all and are widely utilized. The state campground at the end of Woodland Valley Road, which would become inaccessible if Premium Energy Holdings’ plan comes to fruition, is an affordable way for the public to enjoy the idyllic mountain air, water, hiking, and fishing in Woodland Valley. It attracts thousands of visitors annually who bring with them a significant positive economic impact on the surrounding communities and the businesses that call those communities home. Without those visitors and the others who rent houses in the valley, these businesses and the economy of Phoenicia and the surrounding communities would suffer tremendously. They depend on tourism for their survival, and the tourism is dependent on the area’s natural beauty. 

Even conducting a study on the feasibility of such a short-sighted project would cause serious harm to the environment and natural beauty of the region. Building the temporary roads mentioned in Premium Energy Holdings’ filing will create air, noise, and water pollution and damage the environment.

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to use eminent domain to seize privately owned land is inappropriate. They are a private, for-profit entity asking the state to use a provision intended for the public good of all citizens in order to increase their own private profit. Moreover, nearly 75% of the power generated by the proposed plant will go toward running the plant, leaving very little to supplement the existing power grid.

Even if there is a gain in terms of cheaper or additional energy, which seems far-fetched based on the proposal, that gain would be vastly outweighed by the economic cost of acquiring the privately-owned land, the negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, the negative environmental impact of destroying the natural flow of the Woodland Valley Creek, and the destruction and loss of one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in all of the United States: Woodland Valley, New York.

For these reasons, I urge the FERC to stop the wasteful, unnecessary destruction of Woodland Valley before it begins. Deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal before it ruins the quality of life, livelihoods, and well-being of the people of the region and the land itself.

Sincerely,

Phoebe Jones</pre><hr><b>Comments of Drew Boggess under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/20/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Drew Boggess, Shokan, NY.
Comments concerning FERC Project No. P-15056-000

I am asking FERC to deny the application for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan pumped storage project submitted by Premium Energy Holdings on January 29, 2021.  This project application has many severe technical errors in  it.  I will only address a couple of them in this comment.  It is difficult to determine if the applicant is out-and-out lying, or is incompetent, or simply failed to adequately do proper research for this application.

First, on page 11 of the application, the applicant says the system they are proposing is a closed-loop system.  This is blatantly wrong.  The Ashokan reservoir was built approximately 115 years ago and provides drinking water to New York City.  The Esopus creek flows into the western basin of the reservoir along with several small to meadium streams.  The Esopus creek then flows out of the eastern basin of the reservoir.  Approximately 40% of New York City’s clean drinking water flows through the Ashokan reservoir.  So, the system they are proposing is actually an open-loop system.  And as you know, DoE encourages the use of closed-loop systems for pumped storage, not open-loop systems.

 Second, on page 13, 2. A, the applicant indicates the pumping of 15.800 acre-ft would cause the reservoir surface variation of 2 ft based on a reservoir surface area of 8300 acres.  Again, the applicant didn’t do their homework, because they failed to understand how the Ashokan reservoir works.  The Ashokan reservoir has two distinct basins with a dividing weir between them.  The Western basin (this is the basin the applicant indicates pumping will occur) is designed as a settling basin to reduce turbidly in the water before flowing into the eastern basin and on to New York City.  So, water flows from the western basin to the eastern basin and cannot flow in the opposite direction.  Therefore, when calculating the variation of the surface level you must use the surface area of the western basin which is 3106 acres at full capacity.  When pumping 15,800 acre-ft the surface level variation of the western basin would be 5.09 ft.   Also, the western basin has a volume of 143,700 acre-ft when full, which means every day the pump storage system would be pumping about 11% of the western basin volume at full capacity.   These numbers only get worse when the western basin is not full, which is most of the time.

If the applicant can make these serious technical errors at this level of preliminary concept, how can they possibly be trusted to design a system without major flaws?</pre><hr><b>Comments of William Thompson under P-15056.

As a resident of Chichester, NY in Ulster County, I am writing to oppose the granting of a preliminary permit to Premium Energy Holdings. While I support our nation’s transition to renewable energy and recognize the many benefits of hydropower, I believe the Catskills region is not the right location for such a project given significant impacts to state preserved forest land, streams, species, and the New York City water supply. Much of the harm would be unlawful and in violation of the New York State Constitution. Additionally, Premium Energy does not provide the kind of innovation sought by the Department of Energy given that its proposal is deficient and misleading. 

Premium Energy’s claim that it will build a “closed loop” system is false; closer study indicates their proposal is actually an “open loop” system, an “add on” project where an upper reservoir would be added to an already existing lower reservoir connected to a natural water source. As you know, the environmental and aquatic impact of such an open loop system would be significant and damaging. 

The company also falsely states that the project will take place outside the boundaries of the protected Catskills Preserve. Closer study indicates that its proposed sites are actually located squarely within the Catskills Forest Preserve (established 1885). This area is protected under Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which deems the lands “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” Any change in the management of State Forest Preserves have to be passed by constitutional amendment, which involves both state legislative approval and a public referendum. Otherwise, it is unlawful and unconstitutional.

Consider also the fact that, as a State Forest Preserve, the Catskills are considered Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. According the US Department of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision report, “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” 

I believe the protected status of the Catskills Forest Preserve; the misleading nature of Premium Energy’s proposal; and DoE’s mandate to avoid Status 1 land are all reasons to disqualify Premium Energy Holdings from receiving a preliminary permit.

Sincerely,

The Premium Energy Holding’s proposed Ashokan hydroelectric project does is not well suited for the Catskills and the Ashokan reservoir.

Dear FERC,

I have been a full-time resident in Shandaken, NY for the last 21 years, and I am writing to respectfully express my strong opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal to build a pumped storage hydropower plant in our area. I understand the need to move away from fossil fuels to counter global warming and am an ardent proponent of clean, renewable energy. However, the proposed project is totally inappropriate for this area for numerous reasons, a few of which I will mention below.

Premium Energy proposes to build its project in the middle of New York City’s watershed, the Catskill Park and Forest Preserve—priceless public resources. Ninety percent of New York City’s water comes from the Catskill/Delaware ¬¬¬water system, the largest unfiltered water supply in the country, providing 1 billion gallons a day to 9.5 million people. The Ashokan Reservoir, which Premium Energy is proposing to use as its lower reservoir, provides about 40 percent of the city’s daily drinking water. The pumped storage project proposes to build an upper reservoir, in one of three places: along the Stony Clove in Lanesville, along Woodland Valley Stream in Phoenicia, or in Olive by flooding homes on Moonhaw Road. The Ashokan already has problems with silt buildup. Pumping water back and forth from these upper reservoirs would add to the turbidity of the Ashokan, degrading the quality of New York City’s drinking water.

Pumped storage projects are also known to damage stream ecology, with negative impacts on both aquatic and land habitats. Water from an upper reservoir either on the Stony Clove or in Woodland Valley would travel back to the Ashokan Reservoir via the Esopus Creek. The Esopus is a major trout habitat and world class trout fishing stream that attracts fly fishermen from all over the world. Degradation or loss of trout habitat in the Esopus would also cause economic harm to our area.
 
The Catskills Forest Preserve is designated in Article XIV of the New York State Constitution as lands that “shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private.” The U.S. Dept. of Energy’s own Hydropower Vision states that “areas with formal protections designated as Status 1 or 2 under the USGS Gap Analysis Program are avoided for development.” Since the Catskills are a State Forest Preserve, the land that makes up the Forest Preserve is classified as Status 1 land under the USGS Gap Analysis Program. Therefore, the entire Catskill Forest Preserve must be removed from consideration of Premier Energy’s proposed pumped storage hydropower project.

Thank you for your consideration.

As a former New Yorker who owned a home about eight miles from the Ashokan Reservoir and hopes to live near there again soon, I am shocked and disappointed at the thoughtlessness of the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. I have hiked and swam in the Woodland Valley, and attended a square dance (SERIOUSLY, a square dance) at a wonderful gathering place for a group of homes that have been owned by families for a hundred years.  Energy creation by flooding areas that are protected, vital, and carefully enjoyed is not a solution. I object to this proposal&#39;s shortsightedness, environmental destruction, construction impact, and risk to the area&#39;s watershed (not to mention to the residents of NYC who drink this water). Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Allan Goldhammer in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

The proposed pumped storage project is not the best way to provide storage capacity. 

The project is within Catskill State Park.  This is a scenic resource. Residents of the Hudson Valley are very aware of the Storm King pumped storage proposal, which was defeated. Resistance is already gathering.

Other technologies exist to fill this need. Edison battery (nickel-iron) storage was recently put forward as an alternative to an unsuccessful local gas fired peak power plant proposal.  These larger batteries are safer than lithium batteries, so a facility can be the same size as a lithium storage facility which requires spacing of units for fire safety. Several Edison battery storage buildings could be sited around the electrical grid to provide this capacity, even though their energy storage density is not as large as a pumped storage facility. 

Pumped storage reservoirs are not viable living habitats, as they are drained when used, and the contents fed through turbines.  The remaining biomass would be deposited into a drinking water reservoir to decay.   The Ashokan reservoir already has faced water quality problems, which require watershed management regulations, and is now facing sediment management trouble in the lower Esopus.

As a resident of one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 

I do understand and appreciate the need to create more truly renewable energy sources. We cannot allow typical NIMBY concerns to block all projects. 

However, this proposal is truly deficient, would cause massive and irreparable harm to protected lands and to people, and should be denied on its merits. The proposed sites in the Catskills region are on Status 1 land, and the Department of Energy has clearly stated that Status 1 or 2 land must be avoided for any development. The proposed project will cause severe ecological damage, particularly on streams resulting in increased turbidity and sediment in water that serve as an unfiltered drinking water source and blocking the natural spawning areas of trout and other wildlife.

Furthermore, the proposed project is not a true ‘closed loop” energy source and is not the type of innovation that is being sought; it could even result in a net loss of energy given its reliance on traditional pumping to higher elevations.

Hello,

There appear to be material errors in an Amendment filed to this docket dated January 21, 2021; the amendment is identified with a document accession number: &#34;20210201-5022&#34; for FERC project number 15056. In the aforementioned document section titled &#34;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY 18 C.F.R. § 4.32(a)&#34; it is stated: &#34;Every city, town or similar local political subdivision:
(A) In which any part of the project, and any Federal facilities that would be used by the project, would be located&#34; and DOES NOT go on to identify the county, town, or locality of Lanesville, NY, located in the Town of Hunter in Greene County, where the same document proposes a 245-acre reservoir and associated dam.

The wetted footprint of the proposed reservoir, shown later in Exhibit 3 of the same document, would include a small rural town center and the sole arterial road (NY-214) that provides access to the residents of the Stony Clove valley, including my business. To the extent of my knowledge, neither the residents of the directly affected and adjacent areas nor the leadership at the town and county level have been informed of this proposal. 

This reservoir would require the removal or destruction of currently-occupied homes and places of business and it would have direct adverse impact on my business. The community members have not been given their due as stakeholders.

Sincerely,

Eric Ansanelli</pre><hr><b>Comments of Cindy Flamenhaft under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/18/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Cindy Flamenhaft, West Hurley, NY.

I have learned that your company has proposed a feasibility study for a pumped storage facility in the Ashokan reservoir region and I must strenuously object. The region you are considering bringing this to is a State Forest Preserve with the highest possible protective status (Status One) as designated by the USGS. You should have been aware of that from the outset, and so I wonder at the potential for other flaws in your proposal. The region is one of the rarest preserves in New York State of natural forest, with protected wildlife, flora and fauna. This is a rural area with small narrow roads, as well, and any construction through this region would be completely unfeasable. I have very deep concerns about this destructive proposal, and I will make my opinion known to all parties involved.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Natalie Korniloff under P-15056.

It is ridiculous that a company from another state is proposing something that the community hasn&#39;t asked for or needs.  My understanding is that the facility itself will generate 2800 MW but only 800MW go to the community, which I assume we will have to pay for via our electric bill.  My other understanding is that the other 2000MW will be used to run the facility. What is our community to gain??  There will be a huge disruption to the community and ecology of the area. For what?  It can be assumed that this intruding company will somehow make a profit on the back of our community.  Essentially:  How dare they..??</pre><hr><b>Comments of Skye Owens under P-15056.

The areas where these proposed sites exist are all on private land meaning the destroying of property and revenue driving activities for our towns and local businesses.

Been a full time resident at 2303 State Rt 28A, Olivebridge, NY 12461 for the past 17 years. This is one of the most unique places in NYS. Besides being beautiful in any time of the year, its home to some protected species, like timber rattle snakes, bold eagles, eastern hognose snake, bog orchid. Many local creeks and brooks are both trout waters and trout spawning habitats. The Ashokan pumped storage project / FERC project # P-15056 is deficient since it is not a closed loop project, as it involves addition of another reservoir, this project is deceitful and potentially comes in direct conflict with The US Constitution, as the area proposed for the development in FERC project # P-15056 is part of Catskills Forrest Preserve, created by Constitution in 1885.

We own a home in one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity. This project would take place less than 2 miles from our Woodland Valley property. We need constant access to this house, as, being senior citizens, we shelter there during COVID spikes in the greater NY area. I strongly object to the proposal. It defies common sense. I ask that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. Their proposed for-profit project is likely to damage local homes, roads, bridges, and streams in the area, plus denying local merchants and workers their much-needed seasonal income from tourism, skiing, and sport fishing. The increased turbidity in waters will also threaten the unfiltered drinking water source for 9,000,000&#43; residents of New York City. Therefore, the project benefits no one in NY State except its investors, if any such exist outside of PEH&#39;s California-based business. Please do everything possible to stop this ill-conceived proposal now.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header13><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse13 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse13>

To Whom it May Concern,

RE: Docket P-15056

     As a resident of Olive for 27 years whose property is on both sides of the Mettacahonts Creek, I realize the fragility of our precious eco- system and strongly oppose this unnecessary hydro project. The amount of digging and construction in the fragile area proposed would permanently dislodge wildlife, the flora and fauna and countless other forms of life.  
   The Catskills are rich with many smaller streams that are part of the Hudson Valley watershed that are always running. These could easily support a host of micro hydro projects installed by individual home owners that could provide reliable electricity to the area.  
    This project is a bad idea for this area and I strongly oppose it.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Oscar Ogg under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/17/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Oscar Ogg, Olivebridge, NY.

To my dear fellow human beings,

My family has been blessed with a humble home on Woodland Valley Stream for over 50 years.

Woodland Valley is a very special place, with irreplaceable value in the ecosystem, the history, and the ongoing community of the entire Hudson Valley.  Its beauty and value cannot be overstated.

We invite any associates of the PSP Ashokan Pumped Storage Project to come visit and stay with us, so that we may offer you a view of the magic that Woodland Valley offers to those who can respect it.

We open our home to you, in the hope that you will open your heart to Woodland Valley Stream.

In the time we have lived there, we have witnessed an ongoing natural reclamation of a vast ecosystem, hosting myriad stories of life and regeneration.  

This area has been torn apart again and again by human development over the last few centuries, and it deserves the chance to have time to grow back into what it could be again, without the threat of yet another usurious human endeavor poisoning and pillaging its resources.

We locals have seen the way the river naturally flushes itself on an irregular and unpredictable basis, and the unquestionable value of flooding.  Any reservoir at this elevation would most likely be a fool’s undertaking.  We have watched bridges and homes get washed away in the various moods of the stream, and we have learned to respect the power of the water’s choices in its flow.

The stream’s flooding is a phenomenon of nature, and therefore something intrinsically vital to the health of the whole area’s ecosystem.  

To install an artificial device like a dam would surely create something akin to a malignant abscess in a quiet and sacred part of nature.  
 

Please come visit us and let us show you what you can help preserve!

What about the disruption this project will surely have on the quality of the drinking water of NYC’s 18,800,000&#43; residents??  

NYC enjoys some of the cleanest water in the world, filtered by the very stream this project would invade.  Putting any industrial development between the Big Apple and its nourishment would potentially create havoc.  I wouldn’t envy you if your project ever affects the drinking water of those 18 million people.   

And I, personally, have spent many years in California, the source of the energy group proposing to “develop” our area.

I have seen what their reservoirs have done to the countryside out there.

I have seen where they have destroyed so much of their own ecosystems under the guise of “enlightened energy”.  Not only are their reservoirs of water unnecessary out here on the east coast, where we get rain all year long, they are also detrimental to the natural order.

With the decimation of so many fish species, with the destruction of so much riparian habitat, and with wildfires that will burn into history books, the management of water in California has not worked out well.  Now a California power company wants to bring their model here?   

No, thank you.

I invite you all to come visit us, personally, at Woodland Valley. Please come stay with my family and me*. Let us show you the deep value of this very special place.  You will leave with a brighter heart, I assure you.

After a brief visit, you will not only choose to let it be as it is, you will not want to leave.  We will show you some of the good things of what life can be about. 

With hope and gratitude,

The Walker/Halsted Clan,

P-15056-000DOCKET (NUMBER would not come up.) Proposed Hydro electric power Plant abutting Ashokan Reservoir:
Comment is made by a Catskill resident of 30 years, whose home abuts the confluence of Esopus Creek at the Woodland Valley Stream.  I have witnessed major disruptions on the creek many times during high flow events, which include scouring of stream banks, erosion to home and property, and damage to local roads and bridges.  We all have deep respect for the power of water in a storm event. These streams and valleys have taken water flows for thousands of years, and as such have evolved to a high degree of inter-related dependency. Any major change to these streams will have impacts that cannot be estimated and are not worth the risk to the delicate eco-balance that Catskill and NYS residents have determined to preserve by state law over 100 years ago.
Several points about the plan occur to me: It doesn’t look like a “closed” loop plan but looks to be an “open” loop plan, so I am suggesting that be correctly identified to get the correct name in place. I wonder why there was such a major mis- approbation ?
That being said, in regards to putting a reservoir in the Woodland Valley end, or anywhere located in this watershed region,  I have witnessed the deep micro-environmental interdependence of rain, streams, flooding, habitat with animal and human.  These dependencies have evolved in a protective way ever since the Catskill State Forest Preserve was designated protected “wild” by the NYS laws.  To change that would require a citizen amendment, and most would not agree to that- as all who come here place great value on the size of this precious forest, and nature of this protection.
The nature of rain fall, on deep valley streams made of glacial clay is one of delicate balance. 
The continuity and amount of water that empties into the Esopus, cannot be discounted, and are home and habitat to mallards, salamanders, mink, and turtle and frogs.  These creatures are the pillars of the forest floor and need protection from disrupted surfaces of ther ground in the forest. Massive rain fall runs quickly off the steep sides as creeks rise fast and furious.  Just as quickly going down.  a large area unforested such as a reservoir could disrupt the cloud eco-system and rain fall we are so dependent on.

The amount of disruption will cause more erosion on stream banks, disturbance to habitat for animals, and trout, and threaten human structures of homes, roads and bridges.  Turbidity in the water occurs any time water levels exceed the norm, and therefore impact 9 million in NYC.  Water quality is also of import to local residents who depend on clean water to drink.  Turbidity is of a great concern and is easily stirred up.
I believe this proposed project will have enormous impact on the above relationships causing major change in the balancing of the eco systems involved. 

Cycles of seasons have their own specific times of threat- snow melt, spring run off, dry conditions, and drought.  All these situations cause flooding, fire risk, depletion of food sources for animals and birds, and threat to the stream ecology.  Any large intrusion such as a new reservoir put in the basin between two major mountains and an underground channel will bring about unwanted change such as:
species dislocation, fragmenting of forest canopy thus making it difficult for some bird species to thrive such as wood thrush scarlet tanager.  NYS Audubon designated the Catskills as a mature quality forest, and any fragmentation would destroy that.
Possible opportunities for invasive species to come in could occur with a large reservoir or channel tunneling. This proposed project would invite breaking up one of the most highly preserved un- interrupted forest preserves in NYS and on the Eastern coast.

Eco tourism via outdoor natural recreation like hiking, fishing, and camping has contributed to the local economy. The grand scale of this project is beyond the intimate nature of this economy and will have a negative impact on the local permanent residential economy. When residents need to turn to destruction for economic survival due to loss of tourism, that could be consider a causal effect of such a proposal such as this one. Iurge the complete review of this project especially concerning water quality, fish and bird habitat, and weconomic impacts.

Hey you, 

In regards to Docket Number P-15056-000, I, Tiffany Barringer, of the hamlet of West Shokan, strongly oppose.

I invite you to take a moment. Let your mind wander to a place nearby that you go to often that brings you peace. Could be your porch, backyard, the woods, a park, the desert, vacation area, anywhere. These spaces exist, everywhere, whether you are in California or New York City. You have one too. Imagine yourself there. Relive the moments, the memories, the feelings. You are happy. Truly happy. 

Now imagine a stranger sneaking in- and destroying it. The very place you love, the memories stored deep in your mind, in your soul. The one place you feel truly happy. 
Gone.  
Now what do you feel?

There are some things that money cannot buy.

Please, I ask that you, whoever you are, take the time to personally reach out and get to know the local people of the area you have plans to affect. This is our home. I truly believe that if we work together, then there is hope that we can all find a way to make everyone happy.

Dear FERC,
I&#39;m writing to express my concern about this proposal which would dramatically impact the area in which I live both economically and environmentally. Although I whole heartedly support clean, renewable energy sources this project as roughly outlined does not appear to take into account our existing communities residents, economies or environment, to say nothing of its potential impact on the drinking water provided by the Ashokan Reservoir which accounts for roughly 40% of the drinking water supply of New York City.

Our area has already suffered a great deal to create the Ashokan Reservoir which has left bitter memories for residents of areas that were flooded to make way for this project that benefits New York City.

However, we have also come to appreciate the beauty and recreational (and economic) opportunities created by the Ashokan Reservoir including the new and very popular Ashokan Rail Trail that opened late in 2019 to much local acclaim. Businesses have begun to pop up near its access points and we welcome it as a fitting addition that amplifies our area&#39;s reputation for conservation and natural beauty. Although I would be happy to see hydropower utilized, in general, my understanding of this proposal seems like something our region will have to fight. And fight we will... As part of the successful grassroots effort to defeat Niagara Bottling&#39;s attempt to privatize water from the nearby Cooper Lake Reservoir in Woodstock a few years ago, I have no doubt that we can scuttle this project.

I encourage you to find other, more suitable locations (ideally using firms that are based in this region and have a strong understanding of potential locations) for a project of this scale.

Sincerely,
Eve Fox</pre><hr><b>Comments of Laura Nordstrom under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/13/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Laura Nordstrom, Kingston, NY.

I strongly urge that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit for a hydroelectric project near the Ashokan Reservoir. I reside nearby and frequently use the lands near the reservoir for recreation. A large, intrusive industrial project in the neighborhood would severely affect the quality of life in the area and would be sure to result in pollution and environmental degradation in an area prized for its beauty and cleanness. In turn this could adversely affect the economy of the region which relies on its quality of life, beauty and cleanness to attract visitors and residents. The proposed project is too large for our small rural way of life and economy. Damage to roads and runoff of polluted water would be predictable results, and the quality of new York City&#39;s drinking water would be threatened.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Michal Keeley under P-15056.

I have spent summers at our homes in Woodland Valley for 80 years; members of my family have visited there since the late 1800s.  We hope to continue spending time there for many more years. 

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  

The plan, if implemented, will severely damage many properties, as well as the roads, creeks and streams in our area.  It will endanger wildlife in the Catskill Park.  It will create excessive turbidity and endanger New York City&#39;s drinking water supply, most of which is unfiltered when it reaches residents.  And with the threat of climate change, it is unclear how such a project would be affected.  

I completely understand that creative solutions are required to meet the need.  However, this proposal has not been thought through and examined carefully.  For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water&#39;s direction is reversed. Reservoirs actually produce methane, a process that is not well understood.  The cost is way too high for the benefit realized.

I urge you to do whatever you can to block this unfortunate proposal from proceeding further. 

Thank you.

Re P-15056-000 Preliminary Permit re Ashokan

Four generations of my family have spent summers in Woodland Valley in two homes, since the 19th century, and I want to be able to bring my young children and their children there for many summers to come. I am writing to register my profound objections to the Premium Energy Holdings proposal to use our valley, Phoenicia and the Shandaken township as the site for this massive development to generate electricity.  
 
The plan, if implemented, would disrupt and damage many properties, roads, creeks and streams in our area, and endanger the wildlife in the Catskill Park. It will put a dent in tourism in the area and could foment unknown consequences as the climate change. Nine million people in New York City could be affected by endangering the water supply that springs forth from this area. 

This proposal is disingenuous and not fully transparent. For example, pumping water uphill apparently takes power in excess of what is generated when the water&#39;s direction is reversed. Reservoirs produce methane, a process that is not well understood. I understand the need for new forms of power but this is not the clean, environmentally-friendly power intended, and the damage to local economies and ecosystems far outweighs potential benefit.

Hello, 
My name is Selina and I am a Catskills native. Having grown up and still living near the shores of the Ashokan in Boiceville, I am proud of the natural wonders we have in the town of Olive. This was only recently further highlighted by the new Ashokan Rail Trail.

To the employees of the FERC who are reviewing this application, let me begin by thanking you for taking the time to allow the home and business owners near the Ashokan Reservoir the opportunity to opine on this matter. I am currently a resident of New York City, but I grew up about a mile from the Ashokan Reservoir, and I currently own a home and business within about a mile of it. That said, my primary income comes from my career in finance in New York City, so I am involved in the energy markets, including the power market to some degree. Although I am not an expert on the electricity market, I do have a reasonable understanding of how it functions, as well as many of the mechanisms that determine pricing. Based on that background, I can only conclude that it would be a tragedy if this project is approved, as it will likely create very little, if any, benefit for local residents. In fact, from the limited data provided regarding the project, it looks like the bulk of the electricity generated will be used to pump water back and forth by the company, and not for the benefit of consumers. Isn&#39;t it interesting that Premium Energy Holdings decided to submit this application without ever having discussed it with the State of New York, New York City, or the local residents? All this application says is that a company, with no history, understanding or contribution to the area, has figured out a way to make money off of a venture. This would be distasteful to anyone in any town, but it is particularly obnoxious given the significant amounts of taxpayer money that goes to maintaining the Ashokan Reservoir, and the surrounding land, in order to protect it as a primary source of drinking water for New York City. To the locals, the reservoir is very special, as it a magnificent place that not only benefits millions of residents as a source of drinking water, but also as a wonderful example of how conservation and recreation can work hand-in-hand to protect and celebrate our most precious of natural resources. All of that said, I am not debating the need for innovation, as it is at the core of the US economy. However, let&#39;s make innovation make sense. Let&#39;s approve projects that are necessary, can have a massively positive impact on society, and let&#39;s do so in a way that protects the environment. Why would we destroy forests, the habitats of native species, and deface one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in the entire State of New York in order to move forward with a project that will produce no significant benefit to anyone?

March 14, 2021

Dear Kimberly D. Bose,

I am writing to express my overwhelming opposition to Premium Energy Holdings’ short-sighted plan to build a hydroelectric plant in the Ashokan Reservoir region of Ulster County.

As my parents and several members of my extended family have indicated in their own comments, our family has owned a house in Woodland Valley for more than 75 years. The house and the valley it sits in are a family heirloom. While we own the house, the valley and its natural and relaxing beauty are accessible to all and are widely utilized. The state campground at the end of Woodland Valley Road, which would become inaccessible if Premium Energy Holdings’ plan comes to fruition, is an affordable way for anyone to enjoy the idyllic mountain air, water, hiking, and fishing in Woodland Valley. It attracts thousands of visitors annually who bring with them a tremendous positive economic impact on the surrounding communities and the businesses that call those communities home. Without those visitors and all of the others who come to rent houses in the valley, those businesses and the economy of Phoenicia and the surrounding communities would suffer tremendously.

Even conducting a study on the feasibility of such a foolish project would cause serious harm to the environment and natural beauty of the region. Building the temporary roads mentioned in Premium Energy Holdings’ filing will create air, noise, and water pollution and damage the environment.

Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal to use eminent domain to seize privately owned land is spurious. They are a private, for-profit entity asking the state to use a provision intended for the public good of all citizens for their own private profit. Moreover, nearly 75% of the power generated by the proposed plant will go to running the plant, leaving very little to supplement the existing power grid.

Even if there is a gain in terms of cheaper or additional energy, which seems far from guaranteed given this proposal, that gain is vastly outweighed by the economic cost in acquiring the privately-owned land, by the negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, by the negative environmental impact of destroying the natural flow of the Woodland Valley Creek, and by destroying and rendering inaccessible one of the most beautiful, tranquil, peaceful places in all of the United States: Woodland Valley, New York.

I urge the FERC to stop the wasteful, unnecessary destruction of Woodland Valley before it begins. Deny Premium Energy Holdings’ proposal before it ruins the lives, liberties, and ability to pursue happiness of the people of the region.

Sincerely,
Seth S. Tannenbaum, Ph.D.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Alanna Steffen under P-15056. Submission Date: 3/15/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alanna Steffen, West Lafayette, IN.

Hello,

As a resident of one of the Town of Olive in NY State, one of the towns that is being proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity, I VIGOROUSLY OBJECT to the proposal, and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission DENY Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit.

My name is Courtney Williams. I am a resident of Peekskill, NY, but my family has a camp in Big Indian, NY and frequent in Shandaken and the area around the Ashokan Reservoir.

I strongly object to the Premium Energy Holding&#39;s plan to flood more of the area for their project.

Shandaken has already been forever altered by the formation of the Ashokan Reservoir, displacing entire communities to flood them to serve New York City.

This community objects to this project and their wishes should be respected.

Growing up I always dreamed of owning a home that became more than simply a place to live.  I wanted a place to create not just a lifetime of memories for myself but for generations of friends and family.  My family had traveled consistently throughout my childhood and I was always envious of those who had homes in which their parents (or grandparents!) grew up.

When I moved to the Catskills sixteen years ago, I didn’t have the means to achieve this but as I looked around at houses to rent, I was led by a realtor to Stoney Clove Lane.  She explained that a cabin was about to be available.  I couldn’t look inside now as it was occupied, but I could see the exterior. I didn’t even need to.  Simply driving up the road, a chill ran through my body and I realized I had found someplace truly magical.  I agreed to a year lease without ever stepping foot in the cabin.

Within two years I had become dear friends with my neighbors on all three sides.  Across the road was an incredible psychologist from the city who spent her weekends there. To my left, Jeremy Bernstein, born and raised in the Catskills, his father had founded the only private school in Woodstock in the early 60s.  Jeremy went on to become one of my closest friends, best man at my wedding, and eventually built my child his house (but I get ahead of myself).  To my right was Chuck Lankester, a fascinating man who worked in the UN for over forty years, helping shape global environmental policies, including the Kyoto Protocol, portions of which were penned on Stoney Clove Lane!  He had built his home from scratch singlehandedly back in the early seventies, over the course of three years, assisted on weekends by his two teenage daughters.  From cutting down trees to breaking rocks to create the foundation of the driveway, they worked tirelessly on this magical home they dubbed Chalabin: smaller than a chalet, bigger than a cabin.

As Chuck thought of retiring and moving South, I began thinking of marriage.  Before long, I had bought my neighbor’s home, my very first home purchase, and exchanged marital vows on the balcony.  Jeremy worked tirelessly to overhaul the house, and a little over a year later our son Woody was born.  As he got bigger and we started thinking of other children, Chalabin began to feel too small for us.  Jeremy helped us build a second home on the property and unwittingly I was slowly beginning to create the dream property I had yearned for my whole childhood.  

We’ve celebrated birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and global pandemics in this home.  We&#39;ve hosted celebrated writers and academics, painters, musicians, and filmmakers.  We’ve endured days without power where my son helped me melt snow to get drinking water, and we’ve installed a swimming pool for days when it’s just too darn hot to head down to the swimming hole.  We’ve made new friends on the road and kept in touch with old ones (Chuck came back last year with his wife and daughter to visit!).  

The idea that this home of mine--and this community which has thrived long before I arrived--is in peril breaks my heart.  It is so rare to find a place this magical, neighbors this loving and caring, a peaceful haven so pure.  Please, I implore you, do not mercilessly destroy this.  

Thank you very much for your understanding.  

Sincerely,

I am a resident of the Town of Olive, where an application for an underground hydroelectric plant, dam, reservoir, turbine and tunnels as well as other equipment for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity has been made.

Dear Ms. Bose, 
I am writing in response to the proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant at the Ashokan Reservoir in New York’s Catskill Mountains. 
The Premium Energy Holdings project is ill conceived and unwelcome. As a 25-year resident of Moonhaw Road, one of the proposed access roads for the proposal, I can attest to the problems increasing traffic to this road would present. There is substantial pedestrian activity on our road and, with just the recent increase in FEDEX, UPS and other delivery services brought on by the pandemic, there have been many close calls between pedestrians and cars and these larger trucks. Moonhaw Road is not a wide thoroughfare. Our community will not tolerate a proposal that paints our area as sparcely-populated and defines Moonhaw Road as an “access road”.
I hope FERC will reject this proposal and get behind projects that uplift communities and give green initiatives a good name. In addition to local impact, there are several reasons why this project comes up short on an environmental impact level.
On the local level, the property values and tax revenues of the area could be severely impacted. At a time when people are becoming increasingly educated about the importance of the human impact on our natural surroundings this project will have many vocal opponents. Using terminology drawing on “imminent domain” strategies is irresponsible on the part of Premium Holdings. This community has a long history with regards to the imminent domain invoked to construct the Ashokan reservoir.
The area around the reservoir has been so jealously protected in all my years residing here: every building permit, septic system and construction project is met with scrutiny in an effort to guard against any contamination or mishap befalling the drinking water for New York City. As a community we understand the importance of our stewardship of this resource.
As for its standing as a responsible project to generate green-power, the proposal, as described is an “open-loop” project. This is not a good thing. If it moves forward, it will require the construction of an entirely new reservoir to even function and that water has to be pumped to the upper basin during non-peak hours represents the least practical and most disruptive and inefficient solution to a problem that may not even exist. Early projections by Premium Energy explain that the plant would expend 2/3rd of the energy it produces just to operate. In the process, the fossil fuels required undertake construction and the methane released from the proposed new reservoir have been left out of the proposal.  
The proposed project invites problems which would affect 9.5 million New Yorkers down-state who currently enjoy some of the best unfiltered water in the nation. As I understand it, the existing reservoir has an upper basin designed to catch sediment and keep it from the lower basin. The cycling of water to a third basin can only invite contamination from disturbed sediment. I can say from experience that the taste of New York City drinking water is absolutely affected by even subtle changes to these reservoirs as discussed in a Dec 14 article in Patch (https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/tap-water-tasting-funny-nyc-heres-why).
This proposal by Premium Energy Holdings, put forth without prior warning to the affected area or to the city, is not a local project grown out of a community’s needs and demands, it is proposed by a company 3000 miles away prospecting with no understanding of the area’s environmental, historical or economic circumstances.
As FERC advances projects in the interest of alternative energy independence in the days and decades to come, it should support those proposals that feel right and organic and sensible for the affected communities so the nation can get behind this essential move away from fossil fuels.

Please accept this comment as my full disapproval of the this permit application.  The planned installation of a dam and reservoir in the Woodland Valley would have devastating consequences for our community.  The planned location is very near my property and would destroy the much valued Woodland Valley landscape.  It would also have many consequences to the wild fishery population of the Woodland Valley Stream that merges with the Esopus Creek nearby thus impacting recreational fishing activities and water management.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Ann Morris under P-15056.

Please do not let this  proposed plan go through. This will destroy our beautiful environment and will decimate many many people’s lives. People who have lived here for generations, as well as people who have made this their home more recently. Not to mention destroying tourism in this part of the Catskills

I am a resident of Woodland Valley, which is one of the hamlets under consideration by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam and reservoir.  Although I would be justified in vigorously objecting to this proposal as a resident whose home and neighborhood would be destroyed if this project is approved, my objections are far wider in scope.

I object to any expense incurred by Federal, State, County or Town governments in consideration of this bizarre and unbelievably misguided proposal.  My objections are on the grounds that it will negatively impact the natural assets that make this area of unique economic, scenic, recreational, and ecological value to New York and the entire Northeast region of the United States.  Here is a list of four assets (out of many more) which are under significant threat by this proposal:
1.  The water supply for 9 million people in the City of New York and surrounding New York counties.
2.  Breeding grounds for native trout species that provide a beneficial environment for the best fly-fishing recreation area in the eastern United States.
3.  The neighboring protected NYS DEC land designated as &#34;forever wild&#34; by Article XIV of the New York State Constitution, which enjoys the highest degree of protection of wild lands in any state.
4.  Local lands, roads, and streams that are a major economic asset supporting the larger Catskills community, and which will suffer irreparable damage.

As a resident whose family first moved to this area in 1810, I add my voice to all those who are calling on the FERC to do everything in its power to prevent this proposal from moving forward.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Julia Nichols under P-15056.

The proposed project is completely inappropriate in an area that happens to contain the New York City watershed and the Catskill Park, both public treasures.

The construction would also likely harm the character of our rural community.

I am also very alarmed that Premium Holdings didn&#39;t notify the New York City Dept. of Environmental Protection before submitting its proposal and feel that the company&#39;s remiss does not bode well for harmonious community relations.

This ill-advised proposal for massive construction adjacent to the drinking water reservoir that supplies a portion of the water for nine million people seems totally implausible.

No project should be constructed with out the buy in of local residents. The history of the reservoir system in this area is drought with controversy since a whole town was flooded to make it.

The proposal to flood Woodland Valley is totally preposterous.   I have been a homeowner and resident of this valley for 39 years, and there are more than 200 homes of varying sizes in this historic, picturesque setting, which is habitat to a variety of wildlife, and features a world class trout stream, and well as a NY State campground and access to the most popular trails in the Catskill Mountains which lead to many of our peaks.  
Let&#39;s not belabor this ridiculous proposal any longer, and simply withdraw the application.

I am writing to express my dismay with Premium Energy’s application to create a pumped hydroelectric power station and set of reservoirs in the Catskill Mountain region of New York. This project would displace hundreds if not thousands of residents, and scar the beautiful and crucial wilderness areas of the region. Born and raised outside of Woodstock New York, my life has been endlessly enriched by access to these forever wild places, and they are a core aspect of our regions economy. Also, eminent domain may be an abstract concept to most communities in America, but this area still bears scars from a period of rampant land seizure associated with the construction of the NYC reservoirs a hundred years ago. Plans of this kind touch a nerve here, and I hope that FERC will recognize the substantially negative social, economic and natural impact of these plans before considering approval. Thank you for your time, and your service to our Nation.

Regarding Docket # P15056-000, Application for Preliminary Permit for Document of Premium Energy Holdings, LLC Ashokan PSP under P-15056: I wish to register my objections to this project:
 
The proposal has very limited benefits (net power supply) vs the cost to the fragile, protected environment of the Catskills Park.

There would be disruption to local families and businesses. 

It was not created in cooperation with state and local government plans for use of the region

There must be other, better ways to capitalize on the flow of water through the NYC water distribution system, such as installing turbines adjacent to the aqueduct. Some parts of the aqueduct are already currently under rehabilitation. Only through consultation with the state and local authorities and utilities could these be explored.

In light of the above this proposal should be rejected based on cost/benefit, prematurity and lack of planning. Please protect the citizens of NY from this invasion and grab of property by an out-of-state private corporation.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Nian Fish in P-15056.

Re: 
P-15056.000
I vigorously object to the project proposal by Premium Energy Holdings. Premium Energy Holdings wants to create an enormous underground hydroelectric plant adjacent to the Ashokan Reservoir. If this project moves forward, the company would be tearing into the valleys in the towns of Olive and Shandaken, leveling several hamlets, as well as damming streams to create reservoirs as part of what is called “pumped storage”  - electricity to be generated using massive water transport tunnels. Tapping into any energy generated would also require massive new high power electric transmission networks. 

Premium Energy Holdings has not reached out to New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) or the local municipalities that would be impacted by the project. Transparency has not been at the forefront of this massive undertaking and environmentally detrimental project.

Basis for Intervening:
In having read the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project proposal, it my sense that this project risks both the natural characteristics of this area - namely the Catskills Park protected within the New York State Constitution as &#34;forever wild&#34; - as well as the primary industry of this area - tourism.  

A large hydro-electric dam and accompanying reservoir would not merely push aside hundreds of citizens through the necessary eminent domain seizures, but would fundamentally alter the largest industry in the entire county.  Over $500 million is spent on tourism each year in Ulster County and the largest part of that is directly connected to the mountains and streams that make the Catskills once of the prettiest parts of the country.

While clean energy is always a laudable goal, this project does not provide a sufficient return, or sufficient environmental benefits to offset the loss of an entire town hamlet, the destruction of vast areas of forest, and corresponding destruction of a major section of the local and regional economy.

As a resident of Shandaken, New York, my home and livelihood are intimately connected to the watershed of our region.  In this capacity, I respectfully request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission refuse any and all permits associated with this project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jacqueline Kellachan in P-15056.

Hello, I grew up in this area and still love spending time on the protected lands near the Ashokan Reservoir and the lands of New York State that are proposed by Premium Energy Holdings as a site for a large dam, reservoir, turbine, and tunnels for use in pumped storage and generation of electricity.

I vigorously object to the proposal and request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission deny Premium Energy Holding’s application for a preliminary permit. 

The proposed project is massive, intrusive, and if constructed, will damage local lands, roads, and streams and will negatively impact everyone living in this area of the Catskills. 

In addition, the increased turbidity in waters serving as an unfiltered drinking water source for the nine million people in New York City will directly impact me, my family, and our greater community here in NYC. 

Please do everything in your power to prevent this proposal from moving forward, thereby protecting the environment and people, both in the Catskill Mountains and NYC.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Jill Bauerle in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

This is an easy decision. Woodland Valley would seem to be severely devastated by something of this nature. Under no circumstances should any company, less one from out of state, benefit from the destruction of Woodland Valley as we know it.

I’m writing to express my opposition to Premium Energy’s proposal for a hydroelectric power station at the Ashokan Reservoir. I support sustainable energy. But this project and this company are the antithesis of green power. In other projects in the western United States, their plants have decimated fish species, putting them on the endangered species list. They deliberately target land that has Native American interests. The Sierra Club has opposed their projects after extensive analysis of the environmental impact has shown irreparable damage to the environment and the community. Why would we support this proposal or want it?

We live in a beautiful, pristine community. The Ashokan is central to living here. Please do not grant this company the right to destroy what we hold so dear.

This site is not only a beautiful ecological site and family area, but it is the first thing you see when driving into catskill park, and is a tourist attraction from all over the Hudson valley. Not only is its image important, but tourist attraction brings in vital income for the surrounding businesses in catskill park. Constructing this hydro power facility would destroy all of these vital points of interest. In addition to have a serious hazardous impact on the surrounding ecology, it simply would not be an effective source of power. I beg you to reconsider this project, for the sake of local residents, local businesses, tourists, and the surrounding environment that is continually being threatened.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Cassidy Kristal-Cohen in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I&#39;m a concerned situation, who has lived and grown up around the Ashokan Reservoir. I&#39;m asking the FERC to deny the preliminary permit for Premium Energy Holdings LLC.

I question the credibility and qualifications of Victor M. Rojas and Premium Energy Holdings, LLC. Given the significant impact of this project on the local residents and the ecology of the Catskill Forest Preserve, this firm should have at a minimum given a courtesy notice to the key stakeholders - most notably the NYC Department of Environmental Protection and the local municipal governments affected prior to submitting a preliminary application. Premium Energy Holdings has a history of taking a hostile approach to these projects, including in Washoe County, Nevada, Inyo County, California and Walker Lake, Nevada without regard to environmental impact, tribal lands, or even basic feasibility analysis in a changing climate. This company surprises communities with these proposals under the guise of “renewable” energy without material considerations for cost-benefit analysis. There are red flags and severe deficiencies in the application itself. For example, the company states the location of the proposed project is strictly in Ulster County, NY. However, their proposed Stony Clove Reservoir is entirely located in Greene County. Victor M Rojas, a professional engineer swears in his application that the contents of the application are “true to the best of his knowledge or belief”. If he had done even a very basic level of research, he would find that material facts such as the geography upon which his application is based are untrue. This carelessness from the outset is a major red flag as to what other errors and omissions this firm would commit if the project were allowed to progress. 

The Ashokan Reservoir that Victor Rojas proposes to pump water out of serves New York City, the largest city in the United States. This is a valuable resource protected by the NYC DEP and cannot be subject to the fanciful whims and experimentation of a private for profit company on the other side of the country. In recent years, the Ashokan Reservoir has had low water levels due to drought. Pumping water out of the reservoir will further exacerbate this problem due to evaporation. 

The application states that the Ashokan Reservoir water levels will fluctuate by 2 feet during operation of this power plant. This significant water movement not only accelerates evaporation but further disturbs the marine life in the reservoir. The impact is not only limited to the fisheries in the reservoir but the entire food chain. For example, the Ashokan is home to a large population of bald eagles that have made a remarkable comeback in recent years and relies on the fisheries of the Ashokan Reservoir to thrive. This project will undoubtedly have adverse ecological consequences far and wide both during construction and operation. 

Let’s be clear, Premium Energy Holdings has no track record of completing ANY successful projects of this size and scope. Do not indulge Victor M. Rojas and his company in this exercise of pure hubris. 

Let us also not forget the findings in the report submitted to the United States Congress by the Staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in May 2017 titled “Report on the Pilot Two-Year Hydroelectric Licensing Process for Non-Powered Dams and Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Projects and Recommendations Pursuant to Section 6 of the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013”. The report clearly outlines to developers the proper characteristics and approach they should take to licensing. 

In terms of design, “the project would not alter existing flow regimes or cause significant impoundment fluctuations; minimal land clearing would be required; and for projects at non-federal dams, the existing structures satisfy the Commission’s Dam Safety Guidelines.” Premium Energy Holdings is seeking to significantly alter the existing flow regimes of the Stony Clove Creek,  impound water over the major New York State highway NY-214, necessitating this highway to be rerouted, and clear hundreds of acres of land in the Catskill Forest Preserve protected as “forever wild” by Article XIV of the NYS Constitution. 

In terms of environmental characteristics, “there are few, or only minor environmental concerns, for example: there would be no significant change to water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature; the project would not significantly alter the flow regime at the project site; there would be little or no potential for project effects on migratory fish; and there would be no adverse effects on federally listed species and/or
habitat”. The sites proposed by Premium Energy Holdings have exceptional scenic, recreational, and ecological value according to the NYS DEC. Premium Energy Holdings’ proposed dam construction and up to 13&#43; miles of tunneling will undoubtedly have both severe immediate and residual adverse environmental consequences. 

In terms of information gathering and consultation, “stakeholders, especially agencies, are consulted early, and frequently during the term of the preliminary permit and pre-filing to identify, and reach a consensus on, appropriate environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement (PM&amp;E) measures that address project-related impacts. Premium Energy Holdings has made NO effort to notify nor consult the relevant stakeholders including the NYC DEP which owns the lands of the Ashokan Reservoir. 

In summary, Premium Energy Holdings has NO TRACK RECORD of successful projects of this size or scope, has failed to demonstrate the proper characteristics required of such a project, and has failed to take the proper approach to undertaking such a project. Victor Rojas and his firm has further demonstrated a lack of sufficient understanding of the sites based on deficiencies in his application and has repeated these failures in other sites around the country. Based on this, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should promptly deny Premium Energy Holdings’ application for a Preliminary Permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Sophia Sagan in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

Hi, I live in an area near the Ashokan Reservoir and I wanted to submit a comment about the proposed pumped storage facility. Supporting renewable energy is a good thing! but I am concerned about any unintended consequences.
The surveying and construction would obviously disrupt the land and wildlife of the area, so it needs to be determined whether that will all be worth it. The project should be sustainable and efficient while not significantly disrupting the landscape, wildlife, and community of the area. The local residents should also be involved in the process, and make sure the project will benefit the local community in the long term. And if not, alternative projects should be considered.

Basis for Intervening:
The City of New York (“City”) seeks to intervene in this proceeding on its own behalf and on behalf of the nine million people who rely on a daily basis on the City’s water supply system.  The City owns the Ashokan Reservoir, which comprises a large part of the proposed pump storage facility and is an important component of the City’s water supply system.  The City uses the Ashokan Reservoir to supply approximately 40% of the daily water supply needs of its approximately nine million customers.  The outcome of this proceeding could have a direct and significant impact on the City’s water supply system and its ability to serve its customers’ needs.  Accordingly, the City has a substantial interest in this matter.  No other party represents the City’s interests, and no other party reasonably could do so.  The City’s participation in this proceeding is therefore essential to ensure that the interests and concerns of the City and its constituents and customers are heard by the Commission.  The City also submits that its participation will help to advance the public interest.  For the forgoing reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant this motion to intervene.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header22><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse22 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse22>

Some studies suggest hydropower may not be as harmless to the environment as fossil fuels. If hydropower is not more effective as a power source, and even the preliminary tests to see how viable a pump is at the Ashokan reservoir will screw up the ecology here, I suggest it will be detrimental to the community, and that the local government should not allow this to happen in a place that emphasizes preservation of the land.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Wendy Simon in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

I do not believe it would be in the area&#39;s best interest to grant this permit. If approved, the proposed project would cause ecological damage to the forests, streams, and wildlife in the area.  The permit would allow for the destruction of trees and for the construction of roads, as well as the use of explosives.  In my opinion, the risks will greatly outweigh any benefit.  We need to be especially wary and careful these days where the environment is concerned.

Given the paucity of information and (intentional?)lack of spatial specificity as to exactly what the agency&#39;s proposal is or might be, it is difficult to fully assess the potential impacts that such an outrageous and seeming poorly planed project might have (what type of idiots do they think their pitching to, to suggest that the development they propose could be done for $5mil?!!!). But intentionally disturbing the NYC water supply by such a shabby group (as evidenced by simple Google searches, showing they&#39;ve earned the title of &#34;whack-a-dam&#34;), with such a poor reputation across the country, for attempting, willy-nilly, to insert the very same type of for-cash scam, alone seems like sufficient reason to deny any further progress of the proposal. As an earth scientist with a graduate degree and 20&#43; years experience, I&#39;d immediately be greatly concerned about the potential negative impacts and disturbance of the NYC impoundments and infrastructure caused by the apparent proposed penetration of associated ground water systems and surrounding surficial and bedrock geological underpinnings. 

This apparently foreign, for-profit corporation seeking to derive shareholder benefits at the expense and great risk to the NYC DEP and millions of NYC residents must be turned back. Or at the very least be required to conduct a *full* NYS SEQRA impact assessment, accompanied by full public hearings and reviews, before being allowed one inch of forward motion.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header23><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse23 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse23>

Opposition to Premium Energy’s Proposed Underground Power Station

To:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
From:  Robert S. Tannenbaum, 2414 Lake Park Road #2108, Lexington, KY 40502 and
				       848 Woodland Valley Road, Phoenicia, NY 12464
Re:  Docket number P-15056-000


I am unequivocally opposed to the underground power station proposed by Premium Energy of California.

I and all the other individuals or entities who might be affected have received no notice of the proposal by Premium Energy of California to create an underground power station at the Ashokan Reservoir in Ulster County, NY.  The proposal would also entail a new dam at one of three sites upstream from the reservoir and the consequent destructive flooding of an existing valley.  Our only notice is an article in the Kingston (NY) Daily Freeman ( https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/underground-power-station-proposed-on-ashokan-reservoir-property/article_5c328780-72f0-11eb-a379-8bdd4a547ba5.htm), which notes that the City of New York Department of Environmental Protection also was never notified.

The proposed plant appears to be strikingly inefficient.  Only about 25% of the electricity it would generate (800 of the 2,800 megawatts) would be available to the grid.  The remaining 75% would be used to operate the plant.  Furthermore, there was no evidence provided that these 800 megawatts are required or that they were unavailable from other existing sources.  

I am not qualified to argue the engineering failings of the proposed plant, although they do appear to be numerous.  However, I can emphatically argue against it on practical, aesthetic, and personal grounds.

In order to create this inefficient and unnecessary plant, the article indicates that one of the possible dam sites for an “upper reservoir” is in the “Woodland Valley, near Muddy Brook Road.”   A dam at that location would destroy one of the most beautiful, historic, and peaceful streams and valleys in the Catskills.

The Woodland Valley and the Woodland Creek that created it were a favorite of the famous naturalist John Burroughs.  He often hiked there in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  He wrote about it in various of his books, most notably when telling of his climbing of Slide Mountain and then descending into the Valley.  His love of the Valley for its natural beauty was shared by many others in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who made it their home (seasonal or year-round), including painters, musicians, and those who loved and appreciated nature.

My parents were among those who fell in love with the Valley.  More than seventy-five years ago, in 1945, they purchased one of the oldest farm houses in the Valley. We believe that it is the second oldest home still standing.  We know that our house was in existence during the Crimean War (1853-56), because newspaper clippings with dispatches from that war were used as insulation in some of the walls.  Growing up, I spent all of my summers there, wading, swimming, and fishing in the Woodland Creek.  Both of my sons and both of my grandsons also waded, swam, and fished there.  I hope that someday my great grandchildren will be able to do the same.  

However, if Premium Energy is allowed to build its dam, my dreams for my progeny and the dreams of all of my neighbors will never materialize.  Our house may be inaccessible and the Woodland Creek will be forever altered.  The Valley is a thriving community with hundreds of homes, a State Park, and hiking trails that are used by people from all over the eastern United States.  All of this will be obliterated.

In addition, destruction of the Woodland Valley would certainly have an enormous negative economic impact on the surrounding communities, especially the Village of Phoenicia, just a mile from the head of the Valley and home to a renowned annual vocal music festival.  The resultant loss of thousands of annual tourists and hikers, in addition to all of the homeowners, could be devastating to the economy of that village (and the others within a ten-mile radius) that are dependent on both local and transient business.  

I can find no possible excuse (except, perhaps, stockholder profits) for the wanton destruction of such a natural wonder as the Woodland Valley and its Creek.  The same can certainly be said for the two other suggested sites for the “upper reservoir.”  

I am in favor of making maximum use of environmentally-friendly sources of power, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric.  However, I am never in favor of such sources if they damage or destroy natural beauty or existing communities.  For example, I am delighted that we have no huge wind turbines high on the mountains in the Catskill Park, even though they might generate a significant amount of electricity.  The tops of our mountains are to be “forever wild,” as dictated by the Constitution of New York State.  The same should be the case for our valleys.  They must never be wantonly flooded and destroyed for the sake of a (relatively) small amount of power and the profits of some non-resident stockholders.

We are facing just another example of the demolition of the environment in the name of energy.  This threat is analogous to what has happened in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia with the destruction of the mountains through mountain top removal coal mining.  What has been lost there can never be retrieved or replaced.  We must not let the same devastation occur in the valleys of the Catskills.

I urge the Commission in the strongest possible terms to reject this proposal and never let the project proceed.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header24><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse24 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse24>

Dear FERC,

Smart renewable energy initiatives are critical to our country’s long term future stability. I support novel strategies on how we shift away from fossil fuels using hydro, wind, tidal, solar, and even nuclear to become energy independent as a country.

The Ashokan reservoir watershed is not a warranted place for a large scale hydro-battery type project. The proposal put forth by Premium Energy Holdings for the Ashokan PSP is nothing short of ludicrous to see  in 2021. Habitat, residences, history, recreation, geology will be disrupted in a NYC drinking water zone.  

From reporting on the subject,  it seems that the impacted communities and counties and even NYC were not advised that someone was paying for this study and application to take place. If this is the public rollout of this radical proposal,, what does that say about the motives of the company and funded behind it - or their ability to take on something as complex as what is being proposed. 

As a New York resident and someone who already lives down stream of the effects of the western Catskills Delaware reservoirs Please do not advance this proposal.

Dear Ms. Bose

This is a filing concerning docket # P-15056-000.

My family has had a home in the Woodland Valley near Phoenicia, NY for 75 years. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Please do not allow Premium Energy to destroy this piece of paradise with an unnecessary power plant reservoir. Let Premium Energy make (or lose) their money someplace else. The plan to make a reservoir in the Woodland Valley would not only destroy our homestead but would desecrate an area of spectacular natural beauty. It must not be allowed to happen.

To whom it may concern,

I OPPOSE this project. My family has owned a home on Woodland Valley for over 100 years.  Built by my Great Grandfather.  I go every summer for the past 40 years to visit.  I have seen first hand how delicate the balance is on Woodland Creek between normal and floods.  A simple search would show you the damage that was done in the last major flood.  With climate change a fact and expecting more severe weather, we should NOT be changing anything with the water around Woodland Valley.  

It is a fact that Hydro-Power plants are more damaging to the environment than Wind or Solar.   We should be looking into those solutions and not something like this.   A tunnel?  Connecting Water?  A new dam?  In an area prone to flooding?  This is a disaster in the making.   Causing damage to property and the plants and animals that live in the area.  

Do not approve this project.   It will have lasting negative impact to a beautiful natural habitat that should be protected and not destroyed.   

Thank you,

Ira Rubenstein</pre><hr><b>Comments of Elizabeth O'Grady in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056. Submission Date: 2/28/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Elizabeth O’Grady, Phoenicia, NY.
I am adamantly opposed to the possibility of Premium Energy, a California company, installing hydroelectric dams in the Woodland Valley Phoenicia area. It is my determination to make sure that the Valley is not compromised in any manner and not exploited or destroyed for commercial or any other interests.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Roger N Strickland in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056.

Daming Woodland valley to create an upper pool would disrupt more citizens than it would serve. 

As a Chemical Engineer, I am currently collecting facts to quantify the damage the upper pool would create versus the benefit of power generation. 

Our team, located in the Wool\dand Valley, will submit additional comments once we have more information.

At first glance, the proposal is reckless and poorly thought through.</pre><hr><b>Comments of Stephen Ruehle in Docket(s)/Project(s) P-15056. Submission Date: 3/1/2021</b><br><pre style=white-space:pre-wrap>Stephen Ruehle, Poughkeepsie, NY.
FERC P-15056-000 Ashokan Pumped Storage project proposed by Premium Energy Holdings

I am a landowner downstream of the proposed Stony Clove Reservoir. I have three areas of concern with this project.

First, the Stony Clove Creek has experienced four (4) 100 year floods in the past 10 years. These floods have reached a discharge rate of just under 20,000 cubic feet per second. The proposed reservoir will consist of a 212 high  2,618 foot long dam holding over 950 million cubic feet of water. Any failure of this dam will be catastrophic to the hamlets of Lanesville, Chichecter, and Phoenicia along the Stony Clove. It would also impact hamlets of Mt Tremper and Boiceville on the Esopus Creek.

Second, a 13.9 mile 34 foot diameter tunnel is proposed to connect the proposed reservoir to the power generating station. The proposal does not state how deep underground this tunnel will be placed. The tunnel corridor runs through the hamlets of Lanesville, Chichecter, Phoenicia, Mt Tremper, and Boiceville. The wells for the hunderds of properties needs to be considered. Will the tunnel cut through existing wells? Will the tunnel construction damage the aquifer that supplies these wells? What mitigation plans will protect the water supply to these properties?

Third, this project contains an unprecedented amount of construction within the New York City watershed. Not only will dams and tunnels need to be created, but also town roads and NY State Route 214 will need to be relocated to make room for the proposed reservoir. The proposal implies that the Stony Clove reservoir would be on state lands. However a closer look at the details reveals the reservoir would be located just above Lanseville on private land and that NY Route 214 would have to be relocated up the mountain onto state lands that are designate wilderness within the Catskill Park.

This project has a limited benefit for the general public. It will only generate a net 800 mw to be offered to the New York electrical grid. Yet the project imposes a large negative impact on local property owners in terms of long term flood risk and risk to drinking water supply.</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header26><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse26 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse26>

I am writing regarding the Ashokan Reservoir plans to build a hydro plant.  first of all, I would not want to drink water that was residing above a hydro plant, I would imagine there are risk with this.  Secondly, these projects sometime fail and the risk to the local environment, ecological systems would be devastating as well as having no water for NYC residents.  
Im sure there must be a healthier, less toxic way of creating energy...solar, wind power as it is very windy up here.  Im sure an architect could draw up a simple plan of covering the wind power so that they don&#39;t ice up like they did in Texas.  
I personally feel as if the government just randomly makes decisions not taking all into account of the devastation if there is an accident.  I guess if you don&#39;t live here, you don&#39;t care.
Just my two cents,
Thanks,
Ann</pre><hr></div></div></div><div class=card><div class=card-header id=header28><h2 class=mb-0><button class="btn btn-link" type=button data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse28 aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse28>
