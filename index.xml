Submission Date: 4/8/2021 Jacqueline Kuhls, Bronx, NY. The proposal by Premium Energy Holdings to build a hydroelectric power plant in New York’s Catskill Mountains is deeply flawed. I urge FERC to decline their request for a preliminary permit for the Ashokan Pumped Storage Project P-15056, as it would be devastating to the environment, highly disruptive to local communities, and risky for the purity of NYC’s drinking water.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</guid><description>About This site is meant to serve as an archive of resources surrounding Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Forest Preserve.
