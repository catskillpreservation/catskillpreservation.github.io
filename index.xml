Submission Date: 4/6/2021 Kayleigh Zaloga, Saugerties, NY. As a Saugerties resident and frequent hiker and paddler, I oppose the granting of a preliminary license for this proposal. This project is not in the best interest of the people or the environment of the Hudson Valley, and it is so wrong that no local stakeholders have been consulted on it.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</guid><description>About This site is meant to serve as an archive of resources surrounding Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Forest Preserve.
