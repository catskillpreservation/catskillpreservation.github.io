Submission Date: 4/6/2021 Kayleigh Zaloga, Saugerties, NY. As a Saugerties resident and frequent hiker and paddler, I oppose the granting of a preliminary license for this proposal. This project is not in the best interest of the people or the environment of the Hudson Valley, and it is so wrong that no local stakeholders have been consulted on it.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://catskillpreservation.com/contact/</guid><description>About You are welcome to use, copy, modify, and distribute any of the content on this site.

This site is meant to serve as a place for resources and news pertaining to Premium Energy Holding’s proposal for a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility in the Catskill Forest Preserve. I created it to aid community members and facilitate their research for comments on the proposal. The information on this site was initially guided by journalist Ginger Strand’s presentation during a Town of Olive Board meeting.</description></item></channel></rss>
